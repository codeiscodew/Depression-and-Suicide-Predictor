###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. **It's both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someone's suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision.**

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.

It's essential to fight against stigma, misinformation, and discrimination, and to fight for research, treatment, accommodation, acceptance, and understanding.

,SuicideWatch,"I'm 17, GERD, IBS, a fucked up mind, home life and other various health issues have forced me out of education and continue to prevent me finding work.

We have no money, my mum says it's fine but the lack of food and the number of debt letters through the letterbox are starting to show. We have no machine for clothes and the laundrette is either closed or too expensive. 

My brother comes home, makes everything a mess, treats us like shit, plays loud music and keeps me up past 1 am, abuses me, eats what little we have left, moans and goes to his girlfriends. Today he's moved his speakers closer to my wall so if I couldn't hear his music. now I can. I get so sick at night and I down painkillers and pills to stop the nausea and pain. **and he expects** ***me*** **to work.** we are the same age, he has everything given to him and always puts work in at his girlfriends, he uses our house like a fucking dumping ground and we've got to pick up the pieces. I can't stop him or he will hit me or abuse me or break my things. or chase me into my room and take the handle so I can't  get out. 

I was prescribed anti-depressants (**way** too high a dose) when I told my doctor the pain made me want to kill myself. the first dose spooked me and you'll have to restrain me before I even consider touching them again. 

I have no job, no clean clothes, rarely enough food, chronic illnesses and an awful home-life.

I messaged childline and they sent a referral to social services. who called me on a private number. **I can't answer phone calls, he will hear them and then start picking at me for it.** I picked up the guitar and started playing, he said I'm shit, he's so much better. took it out of my hands and started showing off.

You should never choose violence, but I have no choice anymore. 

I'm trying so hard not to break everything in sight or get the scissors and go for my arms again. or throw myself off a bridge. In my emails to childline I made it clear (when I was calm) that the amount I was thinking of suicide or these unwanted violent thoughts had me worried for my own mental health.

&lt;p&gt;We have no money, my mum says it&amp;#39;s fine but the lack of food and the number of debt letters through the letterbox are starting to show. We have no machine for clothes and the laundrette is either closed or too expensive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My brother comes home, makes everything a mess, treats us like shit, plays loud music and keeps me up past 1 am, abuses me, eats what little we have left, moans and goes to his girlfriends. Today he&amp;#39;s moved his speakers closer to my wall so if I couldn&amp;#39;t hear his music. now I can. I get so sick at night and I down painkillers and pills to stop the nausea and pain. &lt;strong&gt;and he expects&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;to work.&lt;/strong&gt; we are the same age, he has everything given to him and always puts work in at his girlfriends, he uses our house like a fucking dumping ground and we&amp;#39;ve got to pick up the pieces. I can&amp;#39;t stop him or he will hit me or abuse me or break my things. or chase me into my room and take the handle so I can&amp;#39;t  get out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was prescribed anti-depressants (&lt;strong&gt;way&lt;/strong&gt; too high a dose) when I told my doctor the pain made me want to kill myself. the first dose spooked me and you&amp;#39;ll have to restrain me before I even consider touching them again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no job, no clean clothes, rarely enough food, chronic illnesses and an awful home-life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I messaged childline and they sent a referral to social services. who called me on a private number. &lt;strong&gt;I can&amp;#39;t answer phone calls, he will hear them and then start picking at me for it.&lt;/strong&gt; I picked up the guitar and started playing, he said I&amp;#39;m shit, he&amp;#39;s so much better. took it out of my hands and started showing off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should never choose violence, but I have no choice anymore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m trying so hard not to break everything in sight or get the scissors and go for my arms again. or throw myself off a bridge. In my emails to childline I made it clear (when I was calm) that the amount I was thinking of suicide or these unwanted violent thoughts had me worried for my own mental health. &lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"Please help me.

I am lately more convinced that I cannot trust anyone not even my mum. That everyone would betray or hurt me. It makes me feel completely alone and like exiting life.

My mum has always been a good hardworking mother but lately she's done a few things.

For me physical touch is a big trigger since I have bad memories associated with it. But positive touch is also something I crave.

She never used to hug us. She has expressed regret about this. We were just that kind of family, no affection.

Now when I hug her, she sometimes puts her hands too close to my butt or chest. I'm usually the one who always initiates hugs. I keep thinking I'm paranoid. Why would even my own mum treat me like this? Like subtly disrespect my boundaries.

She was abused sexually when she was a young woman. Physically as a kid.

Once I was telling her how I want a cat and how I would cradle the cat like a baby. Out of nowhere she said, ""You have me, I'll be your cat!"" Walked around the table to where i was standing, and suddenly hugged me and put her head on my chest. She never did this before or since. It was random and felt uncomfortable.

Once I told her I don't want to hug and she took it as an insult, seemed genuinely hurt. I said that it's cause my hair was smelly. But the truth is she had just hugged me with her hand too close to my chest, like touching the underarm.

She said if I say that it bothers me somehow then she'll never hug me again. She seemed insulted. 

When as a kid I told her how relatives had inappropriately touched my crotch and butt, she told me they meant no harm. But she seemed shocked and kept asking me if they had done something worse. But then it just was brushed under the rug.

She regularly talks about true crime and says how disgusting abusers are.

She called me a whore for staying out late a few years ago in my 20s. When i was younger she'd refuse to let me have a social life, telling me in a mocking tone, ""What for? So you go open your legs and get pregnant??"" Lately she said she was just trying to protect me from ""going down a bad path"" and encourages me to go out now.

But other than those instances she has been a very good, patient, hardworking mum.

Everyone in my life has hurt me. In confusing ways. Why would the same people who are so kind to me then treat me like an OBJECT, an unfeeling thing?

I woke up around 4am with strong thoughts of exiting, cause I feel completely alone.

&lt;p&gt;She was abused sexually when she was a young woman. Physically as a kid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I was telling her how I want a cat and how I would cradle the cat like a baby. Out of nowhere she said, &amp;quot;You have me, I&amp;#39;ll be your cat!&amp;quot; Walked around the table to where i was standing, and suddenly hugged me and put her head on my chest. She never did this before or since. It was random and felt uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I told her I don&amp;#39;t want to hug and she took it as an insult, seemed genuinely hurt. I said that it&amp;#39;s cause my hair was smelly. But the truth is she had just hugged me with her hand too close to my chest, like touching the underarm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She said if I say that it bothers me somehow then she&amp;#39;ll never hug me again. She seemed insulted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When as a kid I told her how relatives had inappropriately touched my crotch and butt, she told me they meant no harm. But she seemed shocked and kept asking me if they had done something worse. But then it just was brushed under the rug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She regularly talks about true crime and says how disgusting abusers are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She called me a whore for staying out late a few years ago in my 20s. When i was younger she&amp;#39;d refuse to let me have a social life, telling me in a mocking tone, &amp;quot;What for? So you go open your legs and get pregnant??&amp;quot; Lately she said she was just trying to protect me from &amp;quot;going down a bad path&amp;quot; and encourages me to go out now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But other than those instances she has been a very good, patient, hardworking mum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone in my life has hurt me. In confusing ways. Why would the same people who are so kind to me then treat me like an OBJECT, an unfeeling thing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up around 4am with strong thoughts of exiting, cause I feel completely alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tl;dr: intense fear that i can&amp;#39;t trust anyone&lt;/p&gt;

2012-2015: world in a bar (Wetherspoons) it was great at first but then it went horrible. Women managers treating me like shit and bad mouthing me to the boss for nothing when the good looking guys could do no wrong and they’re all up their asses. Women customers 75% of the time were snobby and rude to me but when an attractive guy serves them they’re a different person. 

***One girl in there even said to me ‘we had a vote who we girls in here would stay away from and we picked you’ and then giggled (summed my time in there up)***

Guys were mostly good but I’d get the few ‘he’s an ugly bastard him’ comments when I walked away after serving them.

**Even before I had that job I had a job advisor who treated me poorly and made 0 effort  but put all the effort on to the prison hunky chads who sometimes were abusive. That still hurts to this day and it was ages ago**

I left and only did stadium jobs (decent money from it) 2-3 times a week and that was great at first then I noticed things like when I try to help a woman/girl they act all ‘😒’ and roll their eyes at me 

or avoid me and ask someone else further away for help was a regular occurrence 

Had instances where a girl would be with her dad for example and he’s say something to her about me then she’d look over at me and grimace with a disgusted look on her face and he’d be laughing at her playfully 

I’d go out thinking I’d look fine and we’ll and youthful even at 28 but I’d come back sitting still stiff for hours after some shifts at home :/

The only reason they found her was because of the only part payment of rent had run up arrears and they sent bailiffs round to repossess the place.

* I got lucky enough to score a union job that pays reasonably well  ($40/hr) but I live in one of the most expensive cities in the world.  

* I grew up poor and don't know money things but somehow I'm the most adept in my household. Because I can Google.   I know nothing of investing or anything useful.  I'm definitely failing my family here. I just got here by default. 

* This income is not enough to pay my expenses, pay down my debt, and save to own or barely even retire.  I have about 1k savings.  

* My ""lucky"" job is incredibly easy physically but the environment is toxic and destroys my mental state. I wake up with panic attacks and cry most days before my shift. The level of anxiety feels unhealthy.

* my housing isn't very stable, we rent and our lease expired in Feb. We've been month to month since and basically waiting for the other shoe to drop. We know the rent will be increased and can't afford it so have just been going month to month hoping to keep our rent rate.

* we are in debt (probably 30k between credit and bills).

* I'm over 35 and based on how it's going financially I probably won't be able to retire.  

* I'm going to work til I die or die from the stress of working. I feel so trapped. 

* I am terrified of the financial crisis in this country and am so scared ill not find a better position then this without education.

In a month I felt back to square 1 because I was back to the stressful enormous and surprise, all the breathing exercises are much easier to implement when you are practicing alone at home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;my housing isn&amp;#39;t very stable, we rent and our lease expired in Feb. We&amp;#39;ve been month to month since and basically waiting for the other shoe to drop. We know the rent will be increased and can&amp;#39;t afford it so have just been going month to month hoping to keep our rent rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;we are in debt (probably 30k between credit and bills).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m over 35 and based on how it&amp;#39;s going financially I probably won&amp;#39;t be able to retire.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to work til I die or die from the stress of working. I feel so trapped. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am terrified of the financial crisis in this country and am so scared ill not find a better position then this without education. If I leave here there&amp;#39;s just a sea of fake job listing ands and endless qualifications that I don&amp;#39;t have. Even the people around me with degrees have mentioned feeling like I do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just wonder what keeps you going.&lt;/p&gt;

Well, I say that but I'm only doing ""well"" in one class.


I'm trying my best to study for my classes and exams but am unable to focus the majority of the time. I genuinely don't feel like I have anything going for me and even though I'm in therapy it's not helping as much as I thought it would. I can't deal with how everything feels like it's crashing down around me. I don't have a great support system, because if I talk to my parents or my family they just make things so much worse. 


Recently, alongside my mother, my dad also called and basically just called me worthless and says everything bad happening to me is my fault, and if I don't do something to change it I'm gonna kill myself and he won't be surprised. My mother also took half an hour just now to reaffirm everything he said and talked about how I'm not just ruining my life but also my brother's  cause I'm not setting a good example for him nor am I raising him right. They're always taking the liberty of painting themselves as trying their hardest to raise me and doing everything for me and I'm just ruining it all.

But, they decided to bring someone they weren't ready to raise and didn't want, and made sure I knew that I wasn't wanted, onto this stupid planet and now I have to deal with it. 


I'm trying to be a good person, I swear. I do my best to stay kind to everyone, I'm trying my best to keep myself appearing happy around my friends and being there for them or whoever else needs it. Maybe it's all just me being selfish though and I'm not actually trying.

In the past 25 years, I have become completely life-weary, and am now planning my exit. This would have occurred 20 years ago, but I sought the role of being the sole guardian and support to my now 23 year old son. A bright and friendly kid with a cognitive impairment. His mother pretty much “checked” out of his life and General mothering when he was 3, forcing his polio-riddled mother to lead the way in care and support.


I recognized this, took custody, and raised him alone, all while trying to work full time. I shifted to working from home, so I could get to his school if support was needed  placing my personal life on hold. I took lesser paying jobs in exchange for being able to work at home (years before Covid). Then is was Medicaid (when private insurance for part time) became more of an issue. Finally, it was food assistance, to supplement us.


Between speech therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy and occupational therapy, I watching what little savings I had evaporate. Now, at age 23, my son sees how we struggle, and carries the worry I try to minimize from him seeing. 


I’ve not dated in 20 years, and my two remaining and best friends died 24 months apart. I have no emotional support for myself, and as much as I try to keep the topics of money out conversations with my son, they come in. The kind soul with a great sense of optimism he has is fading, supplanted by fears of homelessness.


The last couple of jobs in the professional sector’s I have experience in, I lost assignments to younger talent. And at 58, I can’t compete.


Retirement will never ever be an option, and I refuse to be the ball and chain that drags my son down to the depths of despair or homelessness. 


However, I was recently speaking to my son’s uncle, a kind man a couple of decades younger than me. I’ve had some health scares in the last few years, and he said if I ever became debilitated or incapacitated, he would step in, and care for my son. 


If this is possible, I’d like to plan to transition away from this world. Thinks will, with all and great likelihood, never improve for me. I’ll end up deeper into the system, likely in shelters at best.


If I know my son is with good, caring and protecting people who are family, I’ll feel much more at peace when I leave here. I gave my son the best 20 years I had, and I am spent.

,SuicideWatch,"They always say ""suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem"" or ""it'll get better"". But for me, it won't. I will always be autistic. I will never 'fit in'. I'll never be able to make friends. I will never be interested in or capable of being in a romantic or sexual relationship. So, what is left for me in life? Working? Eating? Sleeping? What a miserable existence.

I have been dealing with passive suicidal ideation ever since I had this realization. And, honestly, I don't believe anyone can help me. No amount of therapy or medication will get rid of the fact that I am different on a fundamental level. I also can't end my life, both out of lack of an easily available method and the effect that it will have on my family. I'm so young, I have ""so much to live for"", so I know that it would be very damaging if I decided to go through with it. I know that these thoughts will eventually lead to me deciding to end my life, despite the ramifications. 

So yeah, that's where I'm at right now. I would talk to someone in real life, but that hasn't been of much help.

But for me, it won&amp;#39;t. I will always be autistic. I will never &amp;#39;fit in&amp;#39;. I&amp;#39;ll never be able to make friends. I will never be interested in or capable of being in a romantic or sexual relationship. So, what is left for me in life? Working? Eating? Sleeping? What a miserable existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been dealing with passive suicidal ideation ever since I had this realization. And, honestly, I don&amp;#39;t believe anyone can help me. No amount of therapy or medication will get rid of the fact that I am different on a fundamental level. I also can&amp;#39;t end my life, both out of lack of an easily available method and the effect that it will have on my family. I&amp;#39;m so young, I have &amp;quot;so much to live for&amp;quot;, so I know that it would be very damaging if I decided to go through with it. I know that these thoughts will eventually lead to me deciding to end my life, despite the ramifications. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, that&amp;#39;s where I&amp;#39;m at right now. I would talk to someone in real life, but that hasn&amp;#39;t been of much help. All I got were the same generic statements (&amp;quot;What are positive things about yourself?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;What are your goals in life?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;ll  get better&amp;quot;)and the treatment of autism as &amp;#39;being different&amp;#39; instead of as a disability that affects all aspects of my life.

I live in Ireland and the rehab I'm going to is a medical facility by law, there are nurses and psychologists there etc.

I've been looking forward to it because I've been addicted to benzo drugs since my late teens, I went to community college twice, then had to drop of of the ""real"" college that I worked hard to get into because by benzo addiction was severe at that point, everyone around me knew something was off so I had to move back home.

I basically have no human contact with my friends from college because they've mostly moved on with their lives and it's been a few years.

Community college was probably the best time of my life. I always thinkg back and get severely depressed that those great times will never happen again. I'm 26 now and I'll be in rehab for almost a year and then going into an aftercare programme where I can try to find accomadation.

Sounds great and all but the future is fucking terrifying. What job am I going to do? For the last year something has been severely wrong with me because I don't really take joy in any of my hobbies anymore. Videogames barely even interest me at all.

I used to like to produce music, and I actually managed to get a fanbase due to my music being on youtube channels and spotify playlists with lots of followers. It was like a dream come true even though it was a small underground thing. it was just a small group of fans who liked my art, and I haven't made any music since 2020. I've always wanted to be a musician as a kid and now I couldn't care less anymore, and everyone who used to listen to all my stuff eventually forgot about me too.

Now I'm supposed to be moving to a rehab clinic for almost a whole year and I have no idea what comes after that. I rang the suicide hotline twice this week. I''ve been taking high amounts of Pregabalin, and I've been drinking more than I ever have because I'm isolated in this horrible house in the countryside alone in my room and have developed agoraphobia due to isolating myself and also due to the withdrawal during my medically assisted valium detox with my doctor.

I've basically been suicidal for a while, and I'm supposed to be detoxing from benzos but I'm drinking so much to suppress the racing and terrifying thoughts.

&lt;p&gt;I cut myself after over a month of being clean. My mom must know somehow, because when I was crying in the bathroom and she yelled at me through the door, “Cutting won’t do anything. Stop playing the victim. You need to grow up.” She also came back a bit later and told me how fat and lazy I was. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My parents don’t know I cut. Or at least I’ve never told them. But given what she says it looks like my mom knows. She just doesn’t care. That’s why I didn’t tell anyone. I knew they wouldn’t care. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dad asked me why I was upset a few hours later. Seems like my mom didn’t tell him. Neither did I. I don’t want him to know I cut just yet. But it doesn’t matter. He thinks I’m spoiled too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told myself I wouldn’t cut until after my birthday. So I could have a good day. I’m supposed to get a massage for my birthday. Not only will my mom see but the massagers will also see. I don’t care anymore. Maybe they should see. Call me selfish, but I want them to know I’m suffering. Even if they don’t care.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I’m writing this in the process of seeking help for myself, but perhaps this might also provide some insight into the internal suffering of those who partake in harassment. The title says it all. I'll provide the shortest possible version, but I will answer any questions and provide more details accordingly.
I met this woman (30F, Cambodian) when I (23M, Canadian) was having my gap term in Cambodia last year. (Forget about why I love her, that's not important). We hit it off massively for about 2 months and made a lot of future plans, but she became emotionally distant when I returned home. Last October, I tried to tell her that I was returning in February for more volunteering, (but with online courses), but she said she wouldn't have time. At that point, things became very difficult; my patience faltered, I suggested we take a break from talking, and I accused her of playing games with me, (while still trying to be polite and reasonable; although I disguised it, this was in fact a desperate plea to prevent her from leaving), to which she responded angrily and said she didn't want to talk anymore. It should have ended there. It was a bit crippling, and my mental state was worsened even further by the disintegration of my family, school stress and a subsequent quarter-life cris which only drove me further into isolation, which only caused me to think about her more, which caused me to cling on even more to the hope of starting a new life abroad by developing my connections in Cambodia. That's how it began.
We didn't talk again until February, although I tried to hold on to her with a Happy New Year message and a few others. When I attempted to reconnect upon arriving, she finally admitted that she was with her new French boyfriend, whom she met at almost the exact same time as me (l'm quite certain he had a girlfriend at the time whom he was with, and unlike me, he was just doing backpacking and amateur photography for 30 days) and whom she visited in France the previous September (I later discovered all those details from social media stalking; she never mentioned a word of it to me).
Being rejected, that was bad enough - but being discarded, abandoned, devalued and written off in favour of someone else? That was so much worse. So... now what? Like I said, quarter-life crisis. I didn't feel like I had a choice at any point along the line.
Although my initial response was composed, things got worse very quick and I had numberous emotional meltdowns in the late hours of the evening, which led to a lot of unhinged emails and DM's. This was when things became abusive and hostile. This later escalated to phone calls. Same response every time. Block. Block. Block. I was so resigned to the situation that I would keep saying
""Just do it, I know you're going to"" or ""my bet is on 30 seconds this time.""
When I am in a more rational mindset, I am constantly shocked by what I see on my phone, I am fighting with myself to stop, and I feel a sense of unbearable remorse - but the cycle keeps repeating itself on every impulse and trigger. I seem to remember every episode well enough, but l'm in a state of dissociation, so l'm only watching myself do it. All of these are red flags for Borderline Personality Disorder, of which I was also a victim (because of my mother).
She's already talked about reporting me to the police if I continue, but I did. The reasons are complicated.
I'm not entirely convinced that they (especially in the 3rd-world) would take this seriously due to the absence of threats, sexual harassment and physical stalking, (which only compounds the remorse, because I know full well that this is wrong solely because of the pain I'm inflicting, consequences aside), and if the worst case scenario did occur, I'm not inclined to care anyway because my out-of-control suicidal ideation. I ruined everything, who cares? No consequences if I’m dead.
Unfortunately l'm cut off from medical care and mental heath resources until return home, but I am trying to connect with a therapist here (at great cost) to find a temporary solution anyway. Now I'm writing this because I want to find anything that would distract me from writing to her again, I want someone to get some empathy through my thick head so I understand fully the impact, I want to believe that I'm better than this, and I want to change my ways. ChatGPT has also been giving good advice, but I want it from a real person. If you belittle me, I don't care. I probably deserve it anyway.
This is an intervention. Under NO circumstances am I to show up at her house. Stop me now before that happens.

,SuicideWatch,"Dealing with homelessness can drive anyone insane.

It has been 6 years of this. Last year I met a man and we are engaged and have been toughing it out together since then. He was also homeless when we met.

I'm disabled. I cannot drive a vehicle. He was able to find work and he can drive. But we can hardly make ends meet, still have to go from spot to spot, motel to motel, or sleep in the car some nights.

When winter comes, we will have nothing left, and may succumb to the weather.

We have called many organizations that assist the homeless to no avail.

I have posted my paypal link on various threads. I have tried selling my music to no avail. Anything to make ends meet. Anything to get assistance.

We are at the end of our rope, and we don't want to suffer anymore. Suicide seems to be a logical choice if we want any semblance of choice over how we die. I don't even want to have to die by suicide, but I don't want to die undignified huddled up for warmth crying in a cold car next to my partner, or worse yet, separated at the hospital dying of an infection because we can't get proper medical care as homeless people.

I just want to make it look like an accident. He and I have discussed going out together by choice, and not just waiting around to die. I don't know what to do. We don't have much in terms of money, friends, family, so our options for help are extremely limited. 

I don't even know that I want to die, aside from the fact that I am disabled and often feel like just a burden, but I feel like my disability wouldn't even affect me as much if a landlord would just rent to us. That is looking to be impossible as we have debt. Thanks for recommending college, boomers.

,SuicideWatch,"Hello there, I’ve been suicidal most of my life. For many of the years I did get help (therapy, CBT, antidepressants). And was misdiagnosed for a long time. I was told that I’ve got depression and anxiety. After many many years, I was then informed (after I’d had a crisis), that’s what I had is borderline personality disorder.

I have kept my symptoms manageable, just about by using medical cannabis. But this has become too much of a crutch. The last year has been extremely difficult. My father died young and unexpectedly. I had severe coronavirus(upto 8pm the currently), which has meant that I missed both of my children’s birthdays, and I’ve seen my general health take such a downturn that I was sure that I would not survive it. 

I then unfairly lost my job. I’m still not any clearer as to why I was let go, but I’m fairly sure it was because I hurt someone’s ego. Since then, everything has continued to be difficult, during which my wife needed my support, and I have failed to give her this. This is because I was still stuck in my own thoughts, still unwell with coronavirus, and feeling like a failure, because of how many difficulties continue to turn up.

We have two children, and there’s been some difficulties around those guys as well, my wife works really hard, to educate them because they’re home educated. And she’s done so fantastically with that, I still failed to understand and acknowledge how much pain and difficulty she was suffering from. 

A week ago, she told me to leave the house, and even though over the last year, I kept telling myself, that “it will get better, it will definitely get better, I won’t have the hardest time forever, I’m a good person and I deserve to do The things I want to do with my life rather than feel like I’m not gonna get anywhere”. In the end though, all the problems have not ceased. 

I’ve been fighting really hard to ignore the, suicidal ideation in my mind. But I’m now a point where I don’t know what to do, my wife needs to move on with her life. When I think about my kids, all I can see is that I bring them pain. I miss them all so much, I just want to make everyone happy.

I’ve realised I’ve got a number of flaws within myself, but I don’t know how I can overcome them. 

I’m just not good enough to be here, I’m a nutjob and I ruin everything around me. God, I wish I could go back to 5 years ago and focus on just living happily with my wife. God, I wish I’d spent the time listening to her, about how she’s struggling, and how much she needs my help. I’m writing on Reddit today, because I believe that I will be going in the next few days. I just want to have one more day with my kids first. 

I wish there was a way that I could convince myself it would get better, but every experience I’ve had recently just tells me I should go and let them all live free.

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been fighting really hard to ignore the, suicidal ideation in my mind. But I’m now a point where I don’t know what to do, my wife needs to move on with her life. When I think about my kids, all I can see is that I bring them pain. I miss them all so much, I just want to make everyone happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve realised I’ve got a number of flaws within myself, but I don’t know how I can overcome them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m just not good enough to be here, I’m a nutjob and I ruin everything around me. God, I wish I could go back to 5 years ago and focus on just living happily with my wife. God, I wish I’d spent the time listening to her, about how she’s struggling, and how much she needs my help. I’m writing on Reddit today, because I believe that I will be going in the next few days. I just want to have one more day with my kids first. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish there was a way that I could convince myself it would get better, but every experience I’ve had recently just tells me I should go and let them all live free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there anything anyone could say to help me please?&lt;/p&gt;

I only mention this because I feel it will be important to understand my complex story and why I don’t think things can get better. Ive dealt with self harm since I was 7 but my first suicide attempt was when I was 11 ive had multiple since then mostly overdoses. Ive been involuntarily hospitalized 10 times 1 of which at a 3 month facility non of them helped me. Ive tried tons of medicines at one point I was misdiagnosed with bipolar so they had me on lithium and they got me up to such a high dose 1800 milligrams a day that i had to see a kidney doctor and they determined I have stage 3 kidney disease from lithium toxicity. I no longer have the bipolar diagnosis they think it was actually BPD but point is ive tried so many medicines to help me in so many different areas some areas have improved but my depression never has. Ive even tried newer alternative medicines such as esketamine. My anxiety I’m on medicine for that helps slightly but not nearly enough but I don’t know what else I can do for it but I get so anxious at points I feel like to escape I have to kill myself. I recently got kicked out of my school because they thought I was to much of a danger to myself to be there and now I’m at home in my room all the time isolated without anyone to talk to because that was my only social circle. I didn’t go to a normal school I went to an autism center because I’m high functioning on the spectrum and I couldn’t handle regular school settings. Ive always had issues with self harm but since I got kicked from my school it’s been really bad. I had a lot of child trauma not from my family because fortunately I was adopted by good parents but I was bullied a lot when I was in public school and in 2nd grade I dealt with SA and it affects the way I think about people to this day I’m scared of people i don’t know. My current plan that I made with my doctor and family is in 3 weeks I’m getting checked in for ECT, and if that doesn’t work I have to go to a long term treatment facility out of state.

Hi, I am just a normal guy and a student but I feel like I have symptoms of ADHD and extreme anxiety.

I cant stop shaking my legs, I cant stop thinking of other things while working on something else, I cant read properly texts mgs and I keep on reading it again and again, I cant stop thinking negative and feel good about myself and more. All of this are making me concerned as it is severely affecting my health and studies and everything. I have noticed many lifestyle changes in my body like not sleeping on time for eg- I sometimes sleep on 10pm but sometimes on 6 am and sometimes on 8pm and so on, Ive been thinking about negativity all the time and seeing downside of everything idk why and gory stuffs, I eat abnormally. I eat a lot of food and all junky food and even tho im full and not hungry i keep on eating it again and again and whenever I try to do something i cant stop shaking my leg and i feel very tired/sleepy. I dont feel motivated at all. And Im thinking on su\*cide for more than a month. I cant share all of this info to my parents as they will be more worried and I dont want them to be sad because of me. I dont want to take bad steps thats why im here trying to get help from you all. I told my mom about some of the things like shaking my leg all the time, ADHD symptoms and anxiety, she said we will visit to a psychiatrist but im too scared to go as i dont know what doctors will think of me and will say ""Big grown ass man cant even do basic things and will think what kind of help this 17 yo man needs"" idk Im really scared to visit a doctor as its not a normal thing to do so especially in India.

I am done with this thing and I need to fix this. I am genuinely concerned with this issue.

I searched a lot on google about all of this, some said taking sleeping pills will help, taking anti depressant will help and some said brain tonic will help you overcome this.

(pls suggest me pills or any medications which can help me out.)

,SuicideWatch,"Okay, so I've been friends with this person a lot of time and we're very close.

They're right now going through a toxic relationship on which they're being abused and they're suffering a lot. I try to constantly help them and give them as much support as I can daily.

The thing is that from time to time they randomly send me messages like ""I am going to kill myself. Goodbye"" or ""I'm going to suicide as soon as I get home. Bye"" and every time they say that I'm about to have a fucking heart attack. (This has been happening for years already, even before they started that relationship, it's just getting more common now.)

The thing is that they randomly say that, I try to ask them if they are okay and try to give them support as fast I can and then they just say stuff like, yeah i'm going through the same thing as always. And then go start a normal convo as if nothing has happened.

I think I have pretty good mental health myself, so I think I can handle it well. But sometimes they're literally one day going I'm going to kill myself, and the next day they send me a photo of them hanging out with the person they're having a toxic relationship super happy as if nothing had happened the day before, while I'm feeling down because of the suicidal messages.

I don't want to call them out on this right now because I know they're feeling depressed and they are probably thinking about killing themselves, and calling them out will make them feel bad for sure, but every time I'm like hanging out with people and I get one of those ""I'm going to end my life, goodbye"" I swear my heart is going to explode.

,SuicideWatch,"I'm extroverted. Have been my whole life. Also, have always had some form of suicidal ideation my whole life. My earliest memory is watching a commercial and finding out suicidal ideation isn't normal. 

Currently, I am finding myself having massive anxiety messaging any friend back. I haven't messaged a friend back in weeks but I'm also upset with myself for not messaging them back, but every day I don't it's harder to respond. 

I go through a moment of feeling good, and then I remember that I didn't message someone, or that I forgot something and then I'm thrown into a spiral of thoughts of just running away from everything. Thinking how it would be easier to just not exist. 

I just recently got into a fight with my mom and she said I don't come down anymore and that I spend more time with my inlaws then them. It's kinda true, but that's because they always invite us out for things and so we see them like 1 or 2 times a month, which is more than I see my family, but I call my mom everyday. I joked about how I've cut everyone off in my life and then she made it a point of how she should just never share her feelings and all this shit. So now I literally have only been talking to my partner because we live together. 

I just needed to vent. I even contacted a helpline for my anxiety and they got scared I was gonna kill myself and said I need therapy so. There's that. Also it's assumed I may have ADHD but because I was just loud in school but didn't fail I never got diagnosed with anything, but it's pretty damn crippling.

,SuicideWatch,"Where can I possibly begin? I've suffered with mental health issues my entire life. I was bullied mercilessly as a child and teenager, which has probably given me undiagnosed PTSD, and I first wanted to kill myself when I was 10 years old. I've had tonnes of diagnoses, but nothing changes it. 

I'm on antidepressants, and they numb it slightly, but this year is breaking me.

It's my first year of university. I was doing better than I ever had in my life, when it all came crumbling down. It started with a girl I was seeing. I was in love with her, my every thought was about her, I genuinely wanted to marry her and spend the rest of my life with her. Then, one day I had a nightmare about discovering online that she had another boyfriend the entire time, and within the dream, my response was to self harm and take my life. Later that very same day... I discovered that she did indeed have another boyfriend, and she'd been playing with me the entire time. Before people start judging me, it wasn't wishful thinking, we'd been on a date, we spoke constantly, we exchanged messages on Valentine's, and she had every opportunity to tell me she was seeing someone else, if she had wanted to.

As you can imagine, my response was not pretty. I suffered a nervous breakdown and slashed my wrists. In the end, my flatmates cleaned me up and called for someone to take me to the hospital. They were beyond useless, they didn't offer me any support, they just put iodine on my wounds then discharged me after 15 minutes. I nearly ended it right there. The hospital entrance opens onto a main road, and I just wanted to step out into the traffic.

From there, things with my flatmates got tense. I've been around mental health issues my entire life, so I don't realise how distressing it is for people to see others in that position. But even so, my flat just treated me different. In the end, we had a meeting, where they revealed it wasn't just that night, but other things which I can't reveal for anonymity's sake. What they said was reasonable, and that should have been the end of it, but it wasn't.

The thing that has finally broken me is discovering that a large portion of the flat and our mutual friends were taking a holiday to the Mediterranean, which they attempted to conceal from me and the others who weren't invited, but failed at that. It's made me feel like a reject, an unwanted hanger-on who does nothing but detract from the lives of others. I've never had friends, even when I was a child, but I adored my flat, even those I've had disagreements with. I don't know why I was excluded, whether I'd just missed the conversation or if there was a genuine reason for it, but it doesn't change how utterly heartbroken I am.

And then, to top it all off, a few days ago someone attempted to blackmail me over the internet, which is currently being dealt with by the police, although it's doubtful anyone will ever be caught.

I don't think I ever would kill myself, I'm too afraid of death to ever go through with it, but every single day, the thought crosses my mind. Sometimes, I genuinely think I make everyone else's lives worse. I actively detract from the happiness in the room.

Today we were at school, in front of our computers. We were talking, as usual, and joking about random things. We both enjoy dark humor, so we don't really have a problem with ""offensive"" jokes.
I don't even remember how we arrived there, but after joking about something, he said something like ""I actually tried to kill myself like that"" or something. At the beginning I thought he was joking. After all, we both enjoy black humor. But then, he showed me his wrists and there were cuts. They didn't seem recent, and at the same time didn't seem too old.
He said that his parents knew about it and that they are worried. I have reasons to believe that he already goes to therapy.

,SuicideWatch,"Dear everyone!

This is my official cry for help. First of all, my intention is not to ask you all for help. The title is kind of ironic. In the last 6 months my life turned upside down. Everything was decent before (not really good, but definitely not bad). Then it took a dark turn, I don't really want to go into full detail but lets just say I got into a bad spending habbit and flew through my money, eventually taking a overdraft on my card and you can guess it. Once I received my pay, I spent it again not even clearing my overdraft. Well, I enjoyed my life less and less to a point where I got depression and suicidal thoughts. 

Also quick: I already had suicidal thoughts a couple years prior because I have a health problem which requires a lot of money which I cannot afford. But I've now lived with this health problem for over 7 years and sort of accepted it. Even thought my life is shit with just the health problem itself.

My spending habbit got really bad in November and onwards from there. I think I now got it somewhat under control but my life is still shit. Every day I wake up, and It's hell all over again. I don't want to live like this. This probably sounds selfish but I really don't think I deserve this life. Looking back to school every single one had a better life than me, and I think I'm a far better person than quite a lot of them but it is what it is, I was born and I cannot undo that.

Every day I look at stories from other people on this reddit and it breaks my heart and I get quite emotional because I can relate sooo much to a lot of them. I just wanted to see if someone that's down like me wants to get friends and stay in contact for long term so we can push through. I feel like we're stronger together. I've never had a real suicide attempt but I've definitely considered it to jump from a high building or jump in front of a train because I have no access to guns and pills.

I really don't know anymore, I'm at a point where I honestly dont see myself living longer for more than 1-2 years. My plan is to get money and SAVE IT to enjoy a bit of it with my family and then maybe order something from the dark web and leave earth. I don't think that I'm destined to be on earth until the age of 25 or older. Unless something drastically changes but even then, the last 6 months have been pure hell for me and I don't even wish that to happen to my worst enemy. I literally went to work every day, got home, then spent the money and looked like a real idiot.

I'm just asking all of you that are suicidal to don't do it and really just talk to a loved one. It might not be your parents etc. I don't know I don't even want to sound like someone that knows what he's talking about because I don't. I just feel like I'm slowly loosing the fight. I tried fighting for 6 months but it didn't work out.

Also, I never really wanted to post something in here, but here I am posting it for a reason. Because I hit a new rock bottom. I have no finances until 3 weeks from now. It sucks. I cant even buy food but I guess I gotta fight through the dumb position I put myself in.

That's been it from me. Hopefully you all can find some joy that I couldn't find.

See you all on the other side at some point",t2_s5wves5p,False,,0,False,Cry for help,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,,,0,,False,t3_12jtf17,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1681321217.0,text,,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my official cry for help. First of all, my intention is not to ask you all for help. The title is kind of ironic. In the last 6 months my life turned upside down. Everything was decent before (not really good, but definitely not bad). Then it took a dark turn, I don&amp;#39;t really want to go into full detail but lets just say I got into a bad spending habbit and flew through my money, eventually taking a overdraft on my card and you can guess it. Once I received my pay, I spent it again not even clearing my overdraft. Well, I enjoyed my life less and less to a point where I got depression and suicidal thoughts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also quick: I already had suicidal thoughts a couple years prior because I have a health problem which requires a lot of money which I cannot afford. But I&amp;#39;ve now lived with this health problem for over 7 years and sort of accepted it. Even thought my life is shit with just the health problem itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My spending habbit got really bad in November and onwards from there. I think I now got it somewhat under control but my life is still shit. Every day I wake up, and It&amp;#39;s hell all over again. I don&amp;#39;t want to live like this. This probably sounds selfish but I really don&amp;#39;t think I deserve this life. Looking back to school every single one had a better life than me, and I think I&amp;#39;m a far better person than quite a lot of them but it is what it is, I was born and I cannot undo that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every day I look at stories from other people on this reddit and it breaks my heart and I get quite emotional because I can relate sooo much to a lot of them. I just wanted to see if someone that&amp;#39;s down like me wants to get friends and stay in contact for long term so we can push through. I feel like we&amp;#39;re stronger together. I&amp;#39;ve never had a real suicide attempt but I&amp;#39;ve definitely considered it to jump from a high building or jump in front of a train because I have no access to guns and pills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really don&amp;#39;t know anymore, I&amp;#39;m at a point where I honestly dont see myself living longer for more than 1-2 years. My plan is to get money and SAVE IT to enjoy a bit of it with my family and then maybe order something from the dark web and leave earth. I don&amp;#39;t think that I&amp;#39;m destined to be on earth until the age of 25 or older. Unless something drastically changes but even then, the last 6 months have been pure hell for me and I don&amp;#39;t even wish that to happen to my worst enemy.

I'm 19 M. my life has been really messed up lately. I don't want to self-diagnose but something is very wrong with me and i don't know how to label it without being disrespectful to ppl who struggle with actual diagnosed mental illnesses.

anyways. for the past 6 months I've been going thru repeatedly traumatic events. last month i distanced myself from my friends over discord who mostly are at least 3 years younger than me. i didn't ghost them Tho I let them know ill be away for a while. I had noticed my decaying mental health and decided that as the older friend I'm responsible to prevent my younger friends, whom I love like my little siblings from being (unintentionally) hurt by me who isn't the most mentally stable at the moment.

i can't reach out to my irl friends abt these stuff even tho i trust and love them. My online best friend is also going thru his own tough time and i don't wanna burden him with my problems for now.

so in this solitude i have resorted to true crime and horror YouTube videos for ""comfort"". even before the events of past 6 months I've always had interest in these types of videos but back then it was a very healthier interest and i watched them as a form of education.

lately i torment myself with them. willingly watching the specific topics that are connected to my trauma that will trigger me. especially the topic of SA. constantly telling myself how my trauma is nothing compared to these and how much of a p\*ssy I am, degrading myself until I'm nauseous. maybe it's a form of S//H because i don't have the balls to do it to myself physically. I don't know, I'm in constant agony and i can't bring myself to stop. i also suffer from intrusive thoughts and they keep getting more graphic and disturbing. i keep having suicidal thoughts it hurts so much

I don’t particularly want to die, just find living increasingly unbearable, and I have a pretty high threshold for that, as I’ve been battling depression for almost 3 decades. But at what point does it become obvious that I’m just needlessly prolonging things, there should really be a checklist of areas to first cover. My only connection is a minuscule, irrational hope that I missed something, though I don’t believe that to be true. 

I’ve been on dozens of different meds, properly taken, from all antidepressant subcategories, except  maoi, as well as countless associated meds. 
Years of therapy, including neurofeedback and emdr. 
Inpatient at psych ward half a dozen times…though it was pretty pointless.

I just can’t believe how abysmal mental health services are in the US. I’ve never once, in all those years, felt like I was in competent hands. Most everything I’ve tried was the result of self-research, have never received any kind of direction from any of the dr’s I’ve seen. But I’m far from an expert, and that research is kind of challenging when in constant state of depression, plus a self view of worthlessness, so hard to put much stake in something if it was my idea to begin with. 

I’m not scared of dying.

,SuicideWatch,"I realized something today and I feel like I have to write it down or the thought of it will disappear. 

As I went shopping with a friend, I asked her for her opinion on something and she made a comment about my appearance that triggered me. I was surprised at how upset it made me and then I realized a fact that had been staring me in the face for years now. 
I let her walk all over me.

I think I have felt this for a while and to be honest I don't even think it's ill intended but it is an unchangeable fact of our relationship.

I realized that I've been allowing people to demean and belittle me my whole life. In fact, I seem to draw out this type of person. Again and again, friend after friend, someone comes along and becomes an instant ""best friend"" of mine seeing that my interests are their own, my dislikes are theirs too and where I am quiet -they are outspoken. Where I am indecisive, they take charge. 

What they don't know is that it is all a lie. I have been (somewhat unknowingly) mirroring them and delivering to them the version of themselves they most like. I mimic their sayings and gestures and make myself small so they can feel big. I allow them to speak for me so they feel needed and important. I allow them to pick on me so they feel better and I allow them to win so they don't feel threatened. Every. Time.

Why? Because I have no interest in being the winner. In being heard, or seen. I have no interest in life. I learned so young to make other people happy above anything else. That no amount of happiness I felt for myself could compare to how it felt to make someone else happy.

Up until now, I have just gone through a cycle of allowing these people to step on me until I no longer feel anything for them and then there is no joy in seeing them happy. When you give them permission, you really see how far people will go to use you. But eventually they will disgust you for this very same reason.

That's when I cut them out. I quickly flip the switch off that I flipped on. I stop lying to myself about how much I love and need them and I go back to feeling absolutely nothing at all.

I don't complain about it because I am a people pleaser and I've learned to put myself last, but that's the thing. It's not me putting myself last. It's the version of me I created to please others. I think there has always been a version of myself trapped inside who CANNOT STAND being belittled. And she gets out sometimes.

Lately, she's been out a lot and she's the part of me that I've been labeling emotionally unstable, but what if she is me? Like the REAL me? What if the version of myself I curated to be a doormat is the version of myself I've been wanting to kill. 

Doesn't it seem reasonable that a person trapped inside their own body would want so badly to be in control they would want to kill the idiot in the driver's seat?

,SuicideWatch,"I don't expect anyone to read it, let alone comment. I don't have a set date yet, just plans, but for now I prefer to write such a letter in advance. I just want to vent and use this post as my last letter. Maybe after my death, someone will want to know why I made such a decision. Or the police may be looking for evidence to make sure it was a suicide and not a homicide. So here's the proof. Unfortunately, finding it will take a little more effort than finding a piece of paper next to the body, but I'm not going to log out of my account, so whoever wants it will find it.

I don't really know where to start, so it's probably best to start at the beginning. I'm 23F and all I really wanted in my life was an emotional connection with another human being. I always wanted someone who would understand me, with whom I could talk about anything and not even in a romantic context, I just needed someone I could call a soul mate, even platonic.

However, here I am as an adult and I've decided that I'm finally giving up and I don't have the strength to fight anymore.

I don't remember most of my childhood, my father was emotionally unavailable and my mother most likely has a narcissistic personality disorder, so it always had to revolve around her. As long as my grandmother was alive, she took care of me. After her death, I spent most of my time at school or with my aunt who did not work, because my parents did not have time to take care of me.  When I was a child, I dreamed that something terrible would happen to me, that I would be on the brink of death, because I believed that maybe then someone would finally pay attention only to me.

However, the mental and physical abuse used by my parents made me think  that a different relationship than one in which I sacrifice myself for the other person, regardless of how that person treats me, does not exist. That's why I've always been drawn to wounded people, I wanted to take care of them and thanks to this, I could also heal this little me who still lived inside me.

Throughout my life I have had many friends, of course, in the background there was a difficult relationship with my parents, which often led me to the brink of suicide. Yet I kept trying to find that escape elsewhere. But I always ended up alone and hurt. For many years I tried to convince myself that my mother's words are untrue, that despite what she says, I am a valuable and good person, that despite my appearance and behavior, someone will want to be with me. But life keeps proving to me that I was wrong, that I'm just a monstrosity whose existence makes no sense. 

I don't want to put all the blame on others because looking back I know that I was garbage at times or acted like an idiot. But I want to let it out, just this one and last time.

I was tormented already in kindergarten, two images in particular were etched in my mind. Girl my age who abused me daily by pulling my hair, pulling my hairpins, and stealing them. The second such person was an older boy who beat me and chased me into a corner until I curled up and covered myself with my hands from his blows. Then he called me names and spit on me. I couldn't defend myself, and the teachers ignored it. As a result, I refused to eat, which resulted in blackmailing me by my carers and parents that they were spending money on food for me, and I did not respect that by not wanting to eat.

Bullying from other children ended when I found my first friend. It was Jay, we had met in kindergarten and became inseparable mainly because neither of us was liked by the other children. I was completely unable to make friends (which I still can't do today), and he was ridiculed because he preferred to play with dolls with girls, rather than with cars like other boys. I also tried to make friends with other children, but they did not want to.

Soon after, a new girl named Sharon joined our class. She came from abroad, so she didn't speak my native language very well, so other children didn't want to be friends with her. Except me. We quickly became friends and that's how our group was formed. Me and Jay and Sharon who only got along with each other and stood out from the rest.

When I was 9 years old, girl named Natasha also joined our group. Since then, there have been times when Nat and Sharon have pushed me aside and spent more time together, and I've grown closer to Jay. I opened up to him about some of my secrets, but he started threatening to tell others everything I told him, which absolutely terrified me. He never did, but for a long time I lived every day in absolute terror that everyone would find out things about me that I preferred to keep to myself. Of course, looking back, if these ""secrets"" came to light, nothing would have happened because they were completely normal things.

Years passed, Natasha found another friend, that's why she left our group, Jay also slowly began to move around in other company, while Sharon stayed with me, but she became very manipulative and I became a source of some emotional release for her. We also got to the age where we started to like boys. I was often too shy to make the first move, so I went unnoticed. Sharon, under the pretext of giving me advice, found out who my love interest was, and then did everything to make him pay attention to her. It usually ended up in a way that when the boy completely ignored me and focused on Sharon, she would lose interest and leave the boy. In the meantime, she also liked to invent various ailments and dramas, leading me to panic attacks more than once, caused by the fact that I was very worried about her.

During this time Jay started hanging out with girls who made fun of me a lot and sometimes Sharon too, I think he made fun of me too, but I didn't know it at the time. One day I complained to him how much I disliked these girls, which he told them right away which only made my life more difficult.

Some time later, as a result of an incident (too complicated to decribe it), I found out that Sharon and Jay were given the choice of spending time with me and receiving a few dollars, or spending time by themselves and receiving several dollars. They chose money. I think that was one of the events that broke my heart more because I just wanted friendship.  
 Some time later a boy named Charles also joined our group. I liked him, but of course he quickly became Sharon's boyfriend. I was still friends with them, but I felt completely unnecessary, which they did not hide. Finally, it was time for us to separate, each going to a different high school. The summer before school, Sharon broke up with Charles, who completely broke down. He turned to me, and I, with my soft heart, could not refuse. We became friends.

At the new school, the first person I met and who wanted to keep in touch with me was Angie. It quickly turned out that she has a difficult past. Abandoned by her family, she was a drug addict, currently living in a center for troubled youth and was completely detached from reality. She wasn't very good at studying either. As I had rather good grades, I decided, apart from friendship, to help her with her studies.

Meanwhile, Charles confessed that he had liked me for a long time. I didn't know how I felt about him, but hoping that my life was finally starting to fall into place and that I had finally met people who would appreciate me, I agreed to become his girlfriend. We were together for two months, during this time he repeatedly compared me to Sharon, even openly telling me that he would never love me the way he loved his ex-girlfriend. When he realized that his relationship with me didn't make Sharon jealous, we broke up. I didn't shed a single tear for him, but I hated him and myself for a long time.

I quickly developed a crush on another boy, whom I told Jay about, with whom I was still in contact. Jay offered to be friends with him too to increase my chances with him. And Jay did that, befriended him, and made that boy stop talking to me. Then my contact with all the people from my previous school finally ended.

Angie, on the other hand, started to do better on tests, so she found a new company ignoring me completely. At that time I got in touch with a girl named Ines. Like me, Ines suffered from depression, so we quickly became close. Angie, on the other hand, got jealous and started tormenting me and Ines for our friendship, even though she had no intention of being friends with me again.

My friendship with Ines was going well, even though it soon turned out that she suffers from borderline personality disorder, and as you know, left untreated can really spoil any relationship. However, I was forgiving despite the fact that her mood swings, suicide blackmails and aggression were vented on me. I just wanted a friend.

At that time, I liked a boy who was a year younger than me, Steven. We started dating, but it soon turned out that he was dating me for my money. When I refused to pay for everything by myself, he just stopped talking to me. At that time, Ines blamed me for any dating failures either because I didn't advise her against a particular boy, or because I believed the person she was dating was okay. Because according to her, as her friend, I should have known better.

Then my self-mutilation escalated to the point where bruises and wounds were visible on my body for everyone to see. But no one saw it or they ignored it on purpose.

I met an older guy online, Tom. We understood each other very well, he went through similar experiences as me, he was as lonely as me. I used to stay up all night to talk to him. He spoke to me so beautifully that I was convinced that there was a feeling between us. I was ready to go to him (because we lived 2 hours away from each other). However, I wanted to tell him about what I live with on a daily basis (depression etc.), because I wanted to be honest. After he found out I was self-harming, he never spoke to me again.

I went to the prom, which I didn't want to go to, just because Ines really wanted it and she said she wouldn't go without me. Ines found a partner, I didn't. I felt lonely and humiliated. After the ball, I waited all alone in the cold and in the dark, because everyone had gone home and my parents had forgotten to pick me up.

But I finished school. I didn't want to go to college, but my parents made me. During this time, I developed an eating disorder by starving myself in the hope that my attractive appearance would help me find someone close to me. I rented an apartment and died a little each day, often lying on the floor in total darkness planning my suicide.

I still kept in touch with Ines, but I also met Patricia in college. I also decided to set up an account on a dating app to meet some people there, because I still had hope. There I first met Matt and then Paul.

Ines met a boy who seemed suspicious to me from the beginning. He demanded strange things from her and behaved inappropriately in general, when I noticed that he told us that he did not like me and began to mock me and my appearance. Ines took his side. I broke off contact with her, but I didn't care because I thought my friendship with Patricia, Matt, and Paul was developing well, even though I only texted with the boys, not meeting them yet. But Patricia got into a relationship and stopped talking to me outside of college. I met with Matt, purely amicably, who quickly ended our contact after this meeting. To this day I don’t know why. Patricia stopped talking to me entirely too.

However, my friendship with Paul developed well. He introduced me to his friend Cameron, so the three of us became friends. Paul, however, started behaving in an ambiguous way towards me, hugging me, holding my hand, and affectionately treated me. Fearing another rejection, I didn't want to fall in love with him, but I finally gave in. However, it soon turned out that Paul had a girlfriend, and yet he continued to behave this way towards me. His relationship was long-distance, so soon they broke up, so I thought things would work out between us now. One day he invited me to a meeting. I was happy being convinced that it was a date. But to my surprise, Paul brought his new girlfriend. I was shocked, but explained it to myself that I must have just fooled myself that someone liked me. It took a lot of time but I finally got over it.

Then I started spending more time with Paul's friend Cameron. We got along very well, we had a similar sense of humor and the same interests. However, I knew Cameron was dating other girls at the time, so I didn't get involved in anything serious. Until one day when I was talking to Paul on discord, Paul told me that I was going to get a surprise today. And indeed, about an hour later, Cameron invited me to a meeting just the two of us. Paul knew this, but when I told him that I agreed to this meeting, Paul got very upset and ended the conversation. I was afraid of meeting Cameron because I was convinced that he and Paul had decided to make fun of me. However, meeting Cameron turned out to be a real date.

It was great, we quickly decided to start a relationship. When Paul found out about it, he confessed his feelings for me. I was shocked again because his behavior made no sense to me because he still had a girlfriend, I didn't address it, and Paul ended our friendship two days later. I understood then that the man I considered my best friend was only friends with me because he probably wanted attention, or maybe he was hoping for sex, because even when in a relationship, he still made sexually suggestive comments at me or often touched me definitely not in a friendly way.

During the next year of studies, I changed my apartment to a room in an apartment with roommates. There I was mentaly harassed by two girls, which created more trauma in me. I broke free of that when Cameron and I decided to move in together.

I left out many details, but I don't want to write that much, because some events and feelings that tormented me are not able to be described.

Cameron turned out to be a wonderful, emotional guy. We've been together for four years and I love him with all my heart. However, my eating disorders, depression and social anxiety are not letting go.

For him, I finally overcame my fear and applied for help, went to therapy, threw away the objects that I used to mutilate myself. I wanted to start my life over.

However, I am here. Therapy made me realize that I will never be healthy, that I will only learn to live with it. I understood that my parents love me, but they are completely immature, that I am not their child for them, but a trophy that is valuable to them only when they can boast of it. Cameron's friends don't even like me, none of them talk to me, even though I tried so hard. 

I'm like a parasite because I can't even go to work due to anxiety. And above all I'm a huge burden to Cameron. I can see how much nerves, life and happiness he lost being with me. I tried to break up with him so he could find a normal girlfriend, but he wouldn't listen. And I still see that no one understands me at all, not my parents, not Cameron, not the therapist. Apart from them, I have no one and I am completely alone in all this.

I feel completely useless, disgusting and meaningless. I also know that I am nothing more than that and that will never change. Everything I wrote, every person and event in my life only confirms who I am truly.

I know that I will achieve peace, let Cameron go free, and get rid of such a useless thing for this world as me only when I die.

So that's it from my side. Maybe someone I know will find this text and understand what happened to me and what influenced my decision.

I don&amp;#39;t have a set date yet, just plans, but for now I prefer to write such a letter in advance. I just want to vent and use this post as my last letter. Maybe after my death, someone will want to know why I made such a decision. Or the police may be looking for evidence to make sure it was a suicide and not a homicide. So here&amp;#39;s the proof. Unfortunately, finding it will take a little more effort than finding a piece of paper next to the body, but I&amp;#39;m not going to log out of my account, so whoever wants it will find it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t really know where to start, so it&amp;#39;s probably best to start at the beginning. I&amp;#39;m 23F and all I really wanted in my life was an emotional connection with another human being. I always wanted someone who would understand me, with whom I could talk about anything and not even in a romantic context, I just needed someone I could call a soul mate, even platonic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, here I am as an adult and I&amp;#39;ve decided that I&amp;#39;m finally giving up and I don&amp;#39;t have the strength to fight anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t remember most of my childhood, my father was emotionally unavailable and my mother most likely has a narcissistic personality disorder, so it always had to revolve around her. As long as my grandmother was alive, she took care of me. After her death, I spent most of my time at school or with my aunt who did not work, because my parents did not have time to take care of me.  When I was a child, I dreamed that something terrible would happen to me, that I would be on the brink of death, because I believed that maybe then someone would finally pay attention only to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the mental and physical abuse used by my parents made me think  that a different relationship than one in which I sacrifice myself for the other person, regardless of how that person treats me, does not exist. That&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;ve always been drawn to wounded people, I wanted to take care of them and thanks to this, I could also heal this little me who still lived inside me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout my life I have had many friends, of course, in the background there was a difficult relationship with my parents, which often led me to the brink of suicide. Yet I kept trying to find that escape elsewhere. But I always ended up alone and hurt. For many years I tried to convince myself that my mother&amp;#39;s words are untrue, that despite what she says, I am a valuable and good person, that despite my appearance and behavior, someone will want to be with me. But life keeps proving to me that I was wrong, that I&amp;#39;m just a monstrosity whose existence makes no sense. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to put all the blame on others because looking back I know that I was garbage at times or acted like an idiot. But I want to let it out, just this one and last time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was tormented already in kindergarten, two images in particular were etched in my mind. Girl my age who abused me daily by pulling my hair, pulling my hairpins, and stealing them. The second such person was an older boy who beat me and chased me into a corner until I curled up and covered myself with my hands from his blows. Then he called me names and spit on me. I couldn&amp;#39;t defend myself, and the teachers ignored it. As a result, I refused to eat, which resulted in blackmailing me by my carers and parents that they were spending money on food for me, and I did not respect that by not wanting to eat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bullying from other children ended when I found my first friend. It was Jay, we had met in kindergarten and became inseparable mainly because neither of us was liked by the other children. I was completely unable to make friends (which I still can&amp;#39;t do today), and he was ridiculed because he preferred to play with dolls with girls, rather than with cars like other boys. I also tried to make friends with other children, but they did not want to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon after, a new girl named Sharon joined our class. She came from abroad, so she didn&amp;#39;t speak my native language very well, so other children didn&amp;#39;t want to be friends with her. Except me. We quickly became friends and that&amp;#39;s how our group was formed. Me and Jay and Sharon who only got along with each other and stood out from the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was 9 years old, girl named Natasha also joined our group. Since then, there have been times when Nat and Sharon have pushed me aside and spent more time together, and I&amp;#39;ve grown closer to Jay. I opened up to him about some of my secrets, but he started threatening to tell others everything I told him, which absolutely terrified me. He never did, but for a long time I lived every day in absolute terror that everyone would find out things about me that I preferred to keep to myself. Of course, looking back, if these &amp;quot;secrets&amp;quot; came to light, nothing would have happened because they were completely normal things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Years passed, Natasha found another friend, that&amp;#39;s why she left our group, Jay also slowly began to move around in other company, while Sharon stayed with me, but she became very manipulative and I became a source of some emotional release for her. We also got to the age where we started to like boys. I was often too shy to make the first move, so I went unnoticed. Sharon, under the pretext of giving me advice, found out who my love interest was, and then did everything to make him pay attention to her. It usually ended up in a way that when the boy completely ignored me and focused on Sharon, she would lose interest and leave the boy. In the meantime, she also liked to invent various ailments and dramas, leading me to panic attacks more than once, caused by the fact that I was very worried about her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this time Jay started hanging out with girls who made fun of me a lot and sometimes Sharon too, I think he made fun of me too, but I didn&amp;#39;t know it at the time. One day I complained to him how much I disliked these girls, which he told them right away which only made my life more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

They chose money. I think that was one of the events that broke my heart more because I just wanted friendship.&lt;br/&gt;

I have tried to get help. I have tried doctors. Doctors are fools. They are beyond idiotic. They worship stupid, pedantic bureaucracy that shields them from ever feeling any kind of responsibility for their inability to help me or initiative to change the system that facilitates their parasitism. The same could be said for therapists and psychologists; these people are the first to tell me that they can’t help me and the last to take any initiative in providing me with any assistance. Time after time, they promise that they can help and that they’re trained professionals, and yet, time after time, they hide behind the pathetic, feeble excuse that they’re not qualified to help me. The deciding factor is the paycheck—they will say anything to me if it means handing them their hundred-dollar-an-hour paycheck, and once the transaction is made, they abandon any prospect of guiding me or assisting me. These people repeat the same oppressive platitudes over and over—“I can’t help you if you aren’t willing to help yourself.” They expect me to solve my own problems. They expect me to fix my own unhealing body and my own shattered psyche—what do I even pay these leeches for? What work do any of these brainless, heartless, spineless parasites even fucking do? I will tell you—it is nothing.

They think that my continued attendance of their treatment is proof that it’s working, but it is not. It never has been. I humor them, I pay them, and I suffer these false doctors because they are all that is there for me to pursue. These hotlines and therapists and specialists that drain my coffers and steal my time are the only people even willing to “help”. If I ever found real assistance, I would abandon them in a heartbeat. But there is no real assistance. There is no way to actually get help, like all these thoughtless bigots keep telling me to do.

No one understands this, and no one cares. I am actively encouraged to end my life at every level, by every authority and every bystander.

This nation, this species, has nothing for me. It never has, and will never care to.

,SuicideWatch,"
It’s been a hard few months. I’m away in college now and it’s strange. Three years ago I was planning on killing myself when I went away. I wanted to wait until I was off on my own. But then, miraculously, I got better. I found new meaning and changed my perspective. 

I don’t want to kill myself anymore. But, part of me wishes I at least tried. When I was suicidal it was all silent. I kept it from my family and friends completely. Even if I hadn’t gotten better they would’ve still been confident sending me off to college in another state. Which was kind of the point, I suppose. I was gonna go off and find some place to die quietly like a cat. 

But I don’t want that anymore. I’m here because there’s things I want to study, things I want to do. But, I just wonder if I hadn’t gotten better, who would’ve known to stop me? I have no one in my life I trust enough to talk about this with other than Internet strangers who don’t know my name.

My campus is small, quiet. And at night when all the commuters have gone home it’s practically a ghost town. If I had found myself up on the roof of the Fine Arts Department late one night, the only person who’d realistically be around to stop me is the hungover 20-something year old security girl who works night shift sometimes. 
And, I don’t know about you, but I don’t think she’s really qualified to handle those kinds of situations. 

idk… I don’t wish I killed myself. I just wish I had my pain acknowledged. Validated. Months ago I considered self-harm, just to feel something in some cathartic way (in my efforts to hide my depression from my family, I’ve repressed my emotions to the point where I can’t even cry anymore. The emotions, the pain, it all just festers inside with no outlet). But, I’ve seen from victims of self harm how addicting it can be. And I’ve decided against it since then. I figured therapy would be better, ultimately. 

It wasn’t. But it doesn’t matter cause I can’t pay for it anymore. I told my therapist all of this and my subscription expired before she could respond, so fml.

,SuicideWatch,"Hey, I made it to 34! That’s a lot longer than I meant to go when I tried to kill myself at 15. I’ll try not to get into specifics on methods so I don’t break the community rules.

I don’t have a good life. I have a partner, but no friends. My mental health has been deteriorating since I was a teenager. I’ve had several breakdowns over the years and several experiences that caused PTSD. I left my job almost 3 years ago. My doctors didn’t think I should be working anymore because of the toll it was taking on my mental health. It took a few months, but I was able to have a psych evaluation done to pin down exactly what I was going through: major depressive disorder, severe anxiety, agoraphobia, BPD, and the list goes on. The evaluation specifically encouraged me to apply for social security disability because they believed it would take a long time for me to get better, if it was possible at all. My partner supported me in pursuing this at the time.

I spent the next two years cycling through therapists while jumping through the hoops of the disability application process. My partner spent the time cycling through jobs to help us get by. Eventually he stopped working and couldn’t find another job. He hasn’t had a steady job in almost a year. It’s caused great financial hardship and stress. Speaking of financial hardship, my disability case was finally reviewed by a judge late last year. With everything I’ve been through and all of my documentation, my lawyer said it was a “slam dunk.” Except I ended up being placed in front of a judge that my lawyer warned me very rarely awarded anything to younger people or those without visible disabilities. So, surprise! I lost my case. No chance of appeal. Everything was tied up with a nice little bow. And my dream of having a little assistance to get by every month was gone. I guess that’s what they call “falling through the cracks.”

This year has been especially hard. I haven’t made any progress in therapy because our financial situation has me so constantly worried and depressed that I can’t bring myself to imagine the possibility that some miracle might come along to make things better. We’ve gone completely through savings and my parents are helping us with bills, what little they can. My partner and I are arguing so often that I’ve learned to keep my mouth shut for fear of being yelled at. I’ve tried reaching out to strangers online for someone to talk to. A way to feel like I’m not alone. I’ve been ghosted by anyone I’ve had a long conversation with. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong, but I’m socially awkward, so it’s probably my fault. I’m not looking for connections here. God knows I’ve had enough of the “it gets better” crowd.

I think Saturday night is a good time to take care of things. It lets me rewatch some of my favorite movies and listen to some of my favorite songs before I’m gone. Gives me time to write a note so no one is left with too many questions and clear out anything online I don’t want people to find. It feels like everything is finally coming to a natural end. And I like the idea of not having to worry about next week.

,SuicideWatch,"I’m only 18. Just turned in November. Doesn’t matter though, because my life still isn’t going anywhere. 

I’m working a job with a boss that I hate, I’m failing 2 of the easiest college classes I’ll ever have to take, my spending habits are so atrocious that I’ve never had a full tank of gas without having to ask my mom for a loan, I gave up on therapy cause I can’t talk things out with strangers, I gave up on medication cause I’d forget to take it and lose the motivation to continue, and I hate myself.

I hate the way I look, I hate the way that I’m bad at my only two hobbies, both of which are supposed to be coping mechanisms but they stress me out and give me anxiety. 

I have no plans for my future. I wanted to be a gaming content creator but I can’t even find the motivation anymore to create said content. I’m not even funny so how could I build an audience? I also suffer from ADHD so trying to create content results in procrastination and distractions. 

If I’m not working or at school I’m in my room playing games. I can rarely hang out with my friends cause of my busy schedule. 

All the shit happening in the US is horrible too. Just more reasons why I don’t wanna live here or live at all, but I can’t afford to leave. 

I’m just so tired. My parents don’t understand what I’m going through, and their constant harassment about school (which I’m being forced to go to) is stressing me out even more. I can’t even talk to them anymore without getting annoyed or mad sometimes.

I just want to be the social, happy little girl that I used to be. 

I’ve thought about it. Attempting suicide and failing just so they could see. But I’m too afraid to. If I didn’t have anxiety I’d have been gone years ago. I can’t do it. I’m scared and I’d feel so guilty. My parents went through hell trying to conceive me, and my friends who are also suffering from mental health need me. I couldn’t possibly leave without seeing my brother again either. He’s in the military, and he’s been gone so long it feels like I’m an only child. 

I just want this pain to end. If I could end the pain without death then I need that help now. I’m so tired, I don’t know what to do.

All the ambitions I used to have, they’re gone. I don’t want anything in life anymore. I have nothing to look forward to. I can’t talk to anyone cause when I do, I feel like I’m a burden and it’s not like they can do anything to help me.

Just turned in November. Doesn’t matter though, because my life still isn’t going anywhere. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m working a job with a boss that I hate, I’m failing 2 of the easiest college classes I’ll ever have to take, my spending habits are so atrocious that I’ve never had a full tank of gas without having to ask my mom for a loan, I gave up on therapy cause I can’t talk things out with strangers, I gave up on medication cause I’d forget to take it and lose the motivation to continue, and I hate myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate the way I look, I hate the way that I’m bad at my only two hobbies, both of which are supposed to be coping mechanisms but they stress me out and give me anxiety. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no plans for my future. I wanted to be a gaming content creator but I can’t even find the motivation anymore to create said content. I’m not even funny so how could I build an audience? I also suffer from ADHD so trying to create content results in procrastination and distractions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I’m not working or at school I’m in my room playing games. I can rarely hang out with my friends cause of my busy schedule. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the shit happening in the US is horrible too. Just more reasons why I don’t wanna live here or live at all, but I can’t afford to leave. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m just so tired. My parents don’t understand what I’m going through, and their constant harassment about school (which I’m being forced to go to) is stressing me out even more. I can’t even talk to them anymore without getting annoyed or mad sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just want to be the social, happy little girl that I used to be. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve thought about it. Attempting suicide and failing just so they could see. But I’m too afraid to. If I didn’t have anxiety I’d have been gone years ago. I can’t do it. I’m scared and I’d feel so guilty. My parents went through hell trying to conceive me, and my friends who are also suffering from mental health need me. I couldn’t possibly leave without seeing my brother again either. He’s in the military, and he’s been gone so long it feels like I’m an only child. &lt;/p&gt;

people are so unfair. they dont even consider peoples health when scheduling social events. ive been wanting to be a shut in for a long time because i couldnt hold a job and all the family trips back and forth to the province made me sick. socializing makes me sick. 
ive been getting dizzy in long drives but i usually have to tag along instead of being left alone at home because my mom is afraid id kill myself. 

the last long drive was the longest, 13 1/2 hours on easter sunday. double the usual time. we visited relatives from holy thursday until sunday. and i had to participate in the good friday procession. my mom caught covid from one of her sisters who i am banned from seeing because im unvaccinated. we found out that my aunt had covid the day after we arrived home. this aunt played mah jongg at her house every day, even after one of her friends caught covid and they had to stop it for a while. 

mom took a self antigen test as soon as we found out. i was sitting beside her the whole ride home and she was already starting to feel sick then, so im sure i caught the bug 100%. been sick since monday. 

people never learn to reduce their social demands, even after the pandemic. another reminder why i want to withdraw from society as a whole. i wish theyd do more than ""sorry youre sick, take some meds"" and do more to prevent things that would lead to people getting sick. because mom and i are definitely not the only ones to spend 10+ in heavy traffic last sunday. im sure lots of other people got sick too. not to mention the pollution from all those cars. 

i dont usually mind traditions but when the conditions are that bad, then the tradition isnt worth it imho. imagine meeting with relatives for christmas and not being able to enjoy new years because of people getting sick during the holidays. 

i want to die. this world isnt worth living in and i dont have any more reasons to live. last night i was having a fever and a meltdown, and i lashed out at the person i love the most. what that person didnt know is that my whole life was flashing in front of my eyes right then and i felt all the hurts from before. 

i lost my bff of 6 years because he had a jealous girlfriend who wouldnt let him talk to exes. it was that easy for him to go no contact, after all ive done for him. he was a broken man when i found him and i built up his confidence. i proofread his works for publication and he won a national award. i helped him review for civil service and he passed. i taught him various things like card games, board games, interesting movies, and how to get steam. not to boast but i practically made that guy and now that gf reaps all the benefits. 

i know im unattractive and boring but i wish someone would stay when ive already devoted so much to them. im always afraid of losing the few friends i have now. and im afraid of getting too invested in someone or something just to fail miserably again, like my studies and work experiences. its so hard to commit to anything and my separation anxiety is through the roof lately. 

i want to be someones favorite person because thats the only thing that gives me a reason to live. everything else is fleeting, people come and go and i know i wont survive alone. im too weak to be alone, i dont have what it takes to take care of myself. so why cant i just die? im a burden and unwanted anyway. i didnt ask to exist. people are so unfair. life is so unfair.",t2_f81f4p4m,False,,0,False,Caught covid because family forced me to go on a trip.,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,,,0,,False,t3_12jalcu,False,dark,1.0,,public,3,0,{},2a7b5518-8e45-11e5-a506-0ed10b342609,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,3,,False,False,,False,modmsg,[],{},,True,,1681275485.0,text,,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;i wish it would kill me finally. &lt;/p&gt;

So my mom yelled at me while on a call with my boyfriend. Told me to clean my room up because I can’t lay on the couch all day. My room is covered in mouse shit. It’s in my bed and in my clothes. At one point I was growing mold in my room. I went to the bathroom to text him about why I left suddenly because it’s the only lockable door. 

Then my mom came up to the door. She must know I’ve been cutting. She said, “Cutting won’t make it go away. You need to grow up. Stop playing the victim. We deserve to live in a clean house too.”

She came to the door again as I was writing. Yelled at me again. I’m not even cutting. I did a few hours ago but not rn. She commented on how fat and lazy I was. 

I hate this house. No one cares. No matter what I do or how I feel they don’t give a shit about me. My dad is trying to take me off my medicine and my therapist stopped sending me links to our telehealth meetings. I don’t know where to go from here.

My husband has been away from me for four months for work. I’m finally supposed to move to him on Friday. We were talking tonight and he barely acknowledged me. He rarely does anymore. I always have to text first. Always have to call first. Have to bug him about getting the things that would make it possible for me to actually move to him. Every time I do call he hangs up quickly because he’s working or with friends or “too tired.”

I made a lighthearted joke this evening that I wish he would get a different job and he hung up on me. I don’t think he even cares about me and my feelings. I have dropped everything to move with him twice now. All of my dreams have been put on hold. I’ve given up dreams entirely for him. I’ve left the job I love and was good at. I’m not acting or singing or dancing anymore. I can’t remember the last time I wrote anything but the draft for a suicide note. I know he’s working very hard and he likes his job, but he’s putting everything before me. I thought when we got married it was an agreement that we would put each other first. I’ve put him first so many times and he never puts me first. 

I’ve worked my ass off the past month getting our stuff packed up, our cats settled with a friend that has agreed to take care of them while we’re in an apartment that won’t allow them, looking for a new job, having to explain over and over again to friends and family why I’m leaving and why he didn’t take me sooner. I’m exhausted from the work and he doesn’t even acknowledge that I’ve been doing it. Doesn’t even seem to recognize that he up and left with just a few days notice and left me to deal with all the pieces. 

He doesn’t even know how shitty and suicidal I’ve felt. I haven’t told him because I know it upsets him. I’ve kept quite and just hoped it would get better once we’re together. I’m starting to think it won’t. 

If I killed myself he wouldn’t have to worry about me anymore. He wouldn’t have the extra costs I come with. He wouldn’t have me nagging. He could get rid of my dog he hates so much. He’d be free to do whatever he wants.

My mom would get to stop worrying about me. She would get to get rid of my stuff that she’s been graciously storing in her basement since the first move.

Hey all, 

I don’t know why, but I find reaching out to strangers very comforting, and feel like I can be open without it changing the perception of me that the close friends/family have of me. 
I also want to state when I say successful, I mean I have reached the goals I set for myself and not in the sense of being an arrogant asshole. 

Just to start with some background, for the past 1-2 years, I have been really struggling with erratic sleep patterns, anxiety/depression, and strong suicide ideation. 
I started talking to a therapist around 4 months ago when the thoughts got very strong and I started meticulously planning the details. My therapist is a great guy, and I really enjoy talking to him/getting his advice. I also got prescribed bipolar/sleep(lexapro) medicine by a psychiatrist as I have a family history of it, but that didn’t seem to help much as my sleep was still ridiculous. In high school, I was always someone who went to bed late(around 12-1), but now in college, I am frequently pulling all nighters or going to bed at 4-6am and not waking up until 3-4pm. It really sucks because I am missing all my classes and the cycle continues as I have to keep up with work. I will say that I do make things worse as I tend to procrastinate all tests/hw, and I am stem major at a top 10 Uni. 
The thing is no one around me notices how miserable I am or I am able to hide it well due to my sarcastic/reserved personality with friends, and the fact I am doing well in school and internship wise.  I just got a big interview, and did well, which made me happy for all of 2 hours before I started to become suicidal again. I feel I am constantly beating up on myself and always so stressed out. It’s been this way for as long as I can remember, even when I got into my Uni(a long term goal of mine), I wasn’t happy about it for long, and started obsessing over the next goal. I have tried to control these thoughts with meditation, medication, talking to people, and planning big lifestyle changes(gym,food, social media), but nothing works. I still hate myself and I just don’t get it. 
Its not like I have troubles in the social scene or family either. I have a loving girlfriend, great friends, and a close family. Yet I still feel so miserable with myself and that I am this big failure, or life isn’t worth living. 

I guess this was just a rant, but if at all possible, I’d just like to hear what everyone thinks about my situation? Does anyone else suffer from self deprecating thoughts? If you got over it, how? 
Tldr: 
Sorry if this made no sense, but to summarize:

I also got prescribed bipolar/sleep(lexapro) medicine by a psychiatrist as I have a family history of it, but that didn’t seem to help much as my sleep was still ridiculous. In high school, I was always someone who went to bed late(around 12-1), but now in college, I am frequently pulling all nighters or going to bed at 4-6am and not waking up until 3-4pm. It really sucks because I am missing all my classes and the cycle continues as I have to keep up with work. I will say that I do make things worse as I tend to procrastinate all tests/hw, and I am stem major at a top 10 Uni. 
The thing is no one around me notices how miserable I am or I am able to hide it well due to my sarcastic/reserved personality with friends, and the fact I am doing well in school and internship wise.  I just got a big interview, and did well, which made me happy for all of 2 hours before I started to become suicidal again. I feel I am constantly beating up on myself and always so stressed out. It’s been this way for as long as I can remember, even when I got into my Uni(a long term goal of mine), I wasn’t happy about it for long, and started obsessing over the next goal. I have tried to control these thoughts with meditation, medication, talking to people, and planning big lifestyle changes(gym,food, social media), but nothing works. I still hate myself and I just don’t get it. 
Its not like I have troubles in the social scene or family either. I have a loving girlfriend, great friends, and a close family. Yet I still feel so miserable with myself and that I am this big failure, or life isn’t worth living. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess this was just a rant, but if at all possible, I’d just like to hear what everyone thinks about my situation? Does anyone else suffer from self deprecating thoughts? If you got over it, how? 
Tldr: 
Sorry if this made no sense, but to summarize: 
I feel like a failure despite measurable success, and that I should end my life to stop the feelings of hatred I have for myself and general unhappiness.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I've been thinking about this for a long time, but I have seriously been considering it again these past few weeks. I even tested out a plan, though I'm unsure if I can go through with it; survival instincts and all that. Chances are I won't succeed, but the point is that I definitely don't want to exist right now. 

I have no special talents. Little to no friends all my life. An overbearing, sensitive, useless, and socially inept mess of a person, I can't even do some of the most basic things in life. How on earth am I meant to survive as an adult soon when I am barely surviving now? To also think that it gets harder? It feels pointless, like I'm wasting my time living and being an annoyance to those around me when I could be dead and gone.

I'm aware the things I've mentioned above are incredibly corny, and it's all been said and thought 
before so many times by so many others, but those are only the surface level details of why I feel so miserable being alive. I wish I could function 'normally' and get on with my life instead of moping around like this. 

I thought I'd be better by now. I thought this black wave in my head would go away. I thought I'd be able to thrive with a fresh start at college and get these amazing grades which I will focus all my energy into, which eventually will help me become a functioning adult.

Obviously, as it turns out, that was all wishful thinking.

I genuinely just can't be bothered to live. I am supposed to go back to college after this week. I was supposed to find somewhere to do my work experience as I currently have none, as well as finish the assignments which I missed due to my many absences, but I am stuck on this idea that I will be gone by then so there is no point, as some kind of form of sick motivation I guess.

But I'm scared. What if I fail and end up in a vegetative state? What if nothing happens, and I'm forced to have to just... keep living miserably. I don't even like doing anything anymore these days. Everything I do reminds me of my depression. I never even asked to be born in the first place!!

I think I just want somebody to save me. I need some older, wiser being that I can cry to. That I can rely on. That I can just *be* with as they guide me through all these heavy feelings. Someone who cares and acts as some sort of parental figure to me, I want this so terribly badly to the point where I actively seek someone out to fill this role.

I had someone like this - my old English teacher. I still have her email, but I would hate to burden her with this, and I am afraid of becoming as attached and obsessed as I was before - I'm doing a decent job not thinking about her as much. I guess having to leave her behind and returning to a life without a mentor/mother-figure just enhances all these feelings. I anticipated it to be horrible, yet nothing could prepare me for such emptiness.

If all goes wrong, I have considered opening up to my current student mentor at college about my suicidal thoughts. She already knows I struggle mentally, and I meet with her every two weeks to discuss my progress through my course and how I am feeling (which is often barely ever truthful). This is honestly a terrifying thought as I am awful at verbalizing my thoughts/feelings, and I am really not sure what would happen next since I'm still a minor. But I'm quite fond of her and really enjoy her presence for some reason. Also she is qualified in this kind of area, so this is kind of a last resort if I even do gather the courage to tell her. If that's even a good idea.

,SuicideWatch,"Hi! 

I'll keep things short. 
I'm taking care of my mother and sister and we aren't doing so great, I had to become homeless to keep up with the monthly installments, meds and other things that come up during the month, my family doesn't know that I'm homeless, they don't know about many things I had to give up on just to keep them afloat, at this point my mother is bedridden, my sister has serious mental and physical issues and she can't work in her current state, everything we have I have to provide for, the past year was just a spiral of issues, one after another just pilling up. 

This month I had covid, didn't know what to do, I had no money for meds, no place to stay, I had to take a doctor's leave from work, I could not work in my second job as a food delivery driver so I'm missing nearly 2,5 week of cash, I was hospitalized after the first 4 days because of fever and issues with breathing.

The thing is I won't be able to provide for them the same way I used to this month, each day I'm lying to them that I'll have the money soon, that I'll make it work and that it'll be okay, but in reality I'm just stalling, giving in to my own thoughts, I'm scared to death to tell them the truth because my sister already tried to commit suicide before because she didn't want to hold me back. The whole situation is so tense that I have no energy to do anything anymore, I'm forcing myself to even go to the toilet at work, I'm working 20 hours a day and it's not enough, I just want to give up, I've been thinking about suicide more and more, since I have a suicide coverage so they would get a huge amount of money and I'll finally be able to rest. This whole thing has been going for years but the last 12 months have been the hardest ones yet, and I've just lost all the will to keep going, and I see no good ending to all of this. 

There is so much more to this story, but I chose to keep it relatively short. I have no idea what to do, how to tell them the bad news, I don't know how can I change this situation in the next 1-2 days, I feel like I'm against a wall, with no options besides giving up, I know that many of you will tell me to keep going, but where exactly will it lead me, I have no plan, no ideas and honestly no strength to keep up the sharade, and I'm afraid that I'm too much of a coward to tell my sister and mother what's really going on and that I can't go on like this for much longer.",t2_vbuvmep3,False,,0,False,My life is getting too hard for me to handle and it is my fault.,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,,,0,,False,t3_12j7vh3,False,dark,0.5,,public,0,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,0,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1681268914.0,text,,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi! &lt;/p&gt;

Lately I'm having anxiety like never in my life and I can't take any decision that implies choosing between two options. To talk with people is difficult and uncomfortable, my mind looses concentration and I return back to my self destroying thoughts.

I wanna end it all, I'm tired of this, why the fuck should I continue living when living isn't to live anymore. I just live on an endless routine with a lot of tasks that make me feel horrible and that I never complete, just making it all worse.

Really there's going to be people in the comments coming at me saying ""you're 20 and you should be on your own anyway"" so why even bother.

,SuicideWatch,"I (14f) have been discussing with my therapist what we could do to better my home life, and she has decided that me and my father will have to fix our relationship in order for my mental health to improve.

I can tell you right now that that's not happening. I know it's normal for teens to rebel and sound like babies when they say they hate their parents, but even after everything I do not hate my father. I'm so angry with him I can't even put it into words, but I don't hate him as a person. Somewhere deep down he is still my father and I'll always partially love him. I just can't forgive him.

Ever since I was little he let me know that I had to be grateful for him. Grateful that he didn't let me get killed by my psychotic mother. Grateful that he held lawsuit after lawsuit against her to keep her away. Grateful that at his oh so old age he still bothered to take care of me and for every other little thing.

As a very young child who had survived an highly physically/emotionally abusive household at my mother's (for which I recently got diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder and am still highly struggling with) I took this in without a doubt.

I started to believe that I was the cause of my father's problems, because he was always stressed about money or lawsuits and was always shirt tempered. He did not hit me or yell too much, but he became unpredictable and I couldn't deal with it at that age.

I believed that I only caused problems to my loved ones, and it started affecting my self image from the age of 8 years old. I viewed myself as a burden and nothing more than that.

I got treated like shit at school too because I was always walking around in clothes that smelled like my father's smoke, I didn't shower nearly enough, i was fatter than most girls my age and I had a generally loud personality which made me odd.

I hated myself. I felt like whatever I did everyone would be happier if I'd never existed. But I couldn't do that, so the next best thing was to die. My own mother had wanted to kill me in the past, and I thought that maybe she was right to do so.

I started self-harming before I even knew what it was or that it was bad. I remember making active suicide plans while sitting on the playground. My plan was to wait for my father to die (he was 70 around that time) and then immediately take my own life, so all his hard work wouldn't have been for nothing. That was my only reason to live.

Every day I walked home from school I hoped a car would hit me, but I was too scared to run in front of one. It was only once that I did try to end it. I think it was the first year of middle school, and I got scared just moments before I planned to do it and I chickened out. I was literal centimeters away from death.

I think I was suicidal from ages 9 to 13. Those are four years of my childhood I will never get back and I will likely never fully recover from this. After all those years I can finally say I do not want to die anymore, but that's only because I started to see how wrong my father was.

I haven't told anyone about this. They knew I had depressive symptoms from time to time, but I've always told them I'd never even had an active suicidal thought before. How am I supposed to explain I almost killed myself at such an age?

I understand that my therapist wants me to forgive him, but I don't think I'll ever be able to do that. To this day he has never taken responsibility for anything and is still telling me that everything is my fault. Even my own depression. No one can talk sense into him or even make him listen, and I've had enough.

My therapist is also thinking about taking me away from him, and believe me he'll kill me when she suggests that. If there's one thing my father hates it's CPS. The things he'll yell at me when she tells him I don't want to live with him anymore will be horrible. I'm just scared and I don't know if I want to keep living with him or leave for a foster home.

I'm starting to worry my school as well. They've been nice to me and let things slide more often than not, and I really appreciate it. I've been staying after my classes longer so I don't have to go home yet. There's a teacher I often go to, and I've told him what's going on.

Today I teared up when he sent me home and to my suprise he teared up as well. He's been so nice to me and maybe I've been hanging around him too much, but he's the only place I feel safe and with everything going on.

&lt;p&gt;My therapist is also thinking about taking me away from him, and believe me he&amp;#39;ll kill me when she suggests that. If there&amp;#39;s one thing my father hates it&amp;#39;s CPS. The things he&amp;#39;ll yell at me when she tells him I don&amp;#39;t want to live with him anymore will be horrible. I&amp;#39;m just scared and I don&amp;#39;t know if I want to keep living with him or leave for a foster home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m starting to worry my school as well. They&amp;#39;ve been nice to me and let things slide more often than not, and I really appreciate it. I&amp;#39;ve been staying after my classes longer so I don&amp;#39;t have to go home yet. There&amp;#39;s a teacher I often go to, and I&amp;#39;ve told him what&amp;#39;s going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I teared up when he sent me home and to my suprise he teared up as well. He&amp;#39;s been so nice to me and maybe I&amp;#39;ve been hanging around him too much, but he&amp;#39;s the only place I feel safe and with everything going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the time I wish I could deal with all of this better, but reading this makes me realise that I have a good reason to be as destroyed as I am.&lt;/p&gt;

Then there’s the fact I’m a cowardly, ugly and pathetic fucking mess who hasn’t done or achieved anything. I genuinely hate myself. I honestly don’t even deserve to be here. I do think I have positives about me, like I think I’m a fairly kind and compassionate person and I think I’m a fairly passionate person with interests and hobbies etc…but I’m not brave or cool or confident or strong or anything stereotypically masculine. I think about hanging myself fairly often. I can’t be bothered with this anymore, I’m just tired and drained and sick of who I am&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch," I’ve never posted on Reddit before, but I’ve been browsing this community for around a month and thought that this would be the best place to talk about this. 

 For the past 6 years I’ve been struggling with severe depression and anxiety. I want to say it started around 5th Grade when I noticed that all my friends had been hanging out with the neighbors without me and making sure I didn’t find out, that crushed me. Things had only gotten worse from there, I lost those friends and began to lose confidence in myself, seeing myself as a fat kid even though it just ended up being baby fat, but at 10 years old I was obsessing over how ugly I was and how I needed to go on a diet. I began starving myself and it was around this time when I found out that my entire grade had a group chat with the exception of 5 people which I was one of, I found that out on my birthday. A year passes by  and I have begun to feel so uncomfortable and betrayed by the people around me that I stopped doing sports to avoid contact with the kids that clearly didn’t like me, it was also around this time (6th grade now) where I began to hurt myself in many different ways (cutting, punching, banging, biting etc.). After a few more instances of bad things happening to me like being blamed for things I didn’t do and getting paired up with the same weird kids at school even though the teachers would say it was “random” I stopped believing in god, and more importantly, I started happily thinking about suicide. It was the one thing that my mind would immediately rush to when I was alone, I would think about it when the classroom was quiet, I would think about it on the bus ride home, I would think about it when I was doing homework, and if anyone has ever been through this kind of stuff, you'll know what I mean when I say it always gets really bad hours before you go to bed. My parents had also gotten divorced a few years earlier and I was beginning to hypothesize if the lack of a father figure is what made me such a loser, and I had begun to hate myself even more. It was getting harder and harder to motivate myself to do anything, my sleep schedule went to 1:00 AM bedtimes, I started eating horribly and I started really procrastinating everything I had to do till the very last minute. I had also lost all passion for anything, when I was younger there were sports that I had liked and topics that I was really interested in, but to this day, there isn't a single thing that I'm passionate about, making my life feel so incredibly empty. I begin to have days where I just go home and cry and feel sorry for myself, and then scream in rage as I punch myself repeatedly in the head until I partially black out from exhaustion. I always kept one rule throughout all of it, and that was to never let my mom or dad find out about what was happening to me, I cared about them too much, and they treated me very well, which only added to how much I hated myself because I felt like a selfish asshole for hating my life even though my parents treated me so well, I just felt sick.

I'm going to skip a bunch of embarrassing and sad things and go right to eighth grade when Covid hit my school. I was at a friends birthday party when I got the note that we would be going back, and we were all stoked. Over the lockdown, I would sit at my computer and play video games and do homework for weeks and weeks and weeks, sometimes I would pull and all nighter just because I could. That was until the day my life changed forever. One day I was playing Fortnite alone (obv) and a kid that transfered to a different school a long time ago invited me to a party. We played a couple games and had a good time until eventually he asked if he could invite a couple of his friends, in which I replied a resounding yes since I hadn't talked to anyone that didn't think I was trash for years. I ended up hitting it off with those people and before I knew it we were all best friends, we would meet and person and proceed to do a ton of thing like parties, movie nights, sport days etc. Little did I know that the guys and girls I was hanging out with were the most popular kids from the towns that surrounded mine. 2020-2021 had to have been the best years of my life. I began to feel confident again, when school came back I was now in high school and all my new friends graduated into those high school as well (it was a multiple town high school). I was feeling so great that I decided to take up football, which I was horrible at but I didn't really care, I was going to parties every two weeks, my snapchat was always blowing up, and there were actually girls that liked me. In October of 2021, a really cure girl way out of my league said she would kill to date/go to homecoming with me, this was the best news I has ever received in my life, I immediately said that I liked her too and we technically started dating. However, I would never get to take her on that date, or homecoming. About a week after that all went down something happened, and I to this day dont know what it was, but she called me, and she seemed very off, very not like herself. She told me she didn't want to date me anymore, and at first I just said okay like it was no big deal, but the next day I woke up and just felt horrible about it, how my first ""girlfriend"" lasted a week, and completely tanked my confidence. I went to a party the next week, a Halloween party, and everyone seemed off about me there too, and again, I have no clue what it was to this day that caused it, but before I know it, after that party, I would never see a party again. 

Since that night I have one again become an irrelevant loser and I have regained all my old habits of hating/hurting myself and I feel like shit everyday. Every girl I meet seems to notice my lack of confidence and quickly loses interest. My porn addiction also skyrocketed after that night, and I cry almost every time I do it just because I can see my life from a third-person perspective and notice how alone I am, and how much I lost. I had the world in my hand, and everyone looked up to me, now I am nothing but a loser that gets made fun of behind his back everyday. I've been going to the gym for two years now and have made decent progress on my body, but that hasn't done anything with the confidence issue. I always have phases where I put a smile on my face and say that today the day where I change and everything gets better and I get all those friends back, but I always fail miserably. All my friends are now way more popular than me and getting invited to things I could only dream about going, I've still never had a ""real"" girlfriend and I hate myself.

I'm a 17 year old Junior in high school now, and the cycle hasn't ended, everything's horrible and nothings changed. I have tried everything I could, yet it seems like I was just but on this planet to fail. I can't take it anymore, I dont want to experience another day in the war that my mind is in every second of every day, this is the end of the road, and I'm done. I'm sick of being a loser, I'm sick of being made fun of, and I'm sick of seeing everyone around me succeed while my life gets worse.

,SuicideWatch,"I (13f) am done. Im done with all of this shit. 

I’ve been suicidal since I was eight. I’m so tired of life. My moms a recovering alcoholic and her girlfriends an alcoholic psycho. For as long as I can remember it’s just been them screaming and fighting, moms gf getting locked up for a while, her gf coming back and it being fine, then eventually everything goes to shit. I have major depressive disorder, anxiety, and ADD/ADHD. I can’t stand being me. I hate myself so much. I have anger issues that picked up from my moms gf. I can’t stand socializing. Every time I get yelled at I have a panic attack. Even when it’s not yelling, sometimes people get mad at me and I just break down crying for no fucking reason whatsoever. Hell they could have just come up behind me and made me flinch, sometimes that’ll make me cry. Im ruined. 

The only reason I’m still alive is because I’m scared. Im not scared of death I’m just scared of my family being upset. My mom would be devastated.

But what about my dog. I love her so much. We’ve had her since she was a baby and she’s four now. She’s been the biggest thing keeping me alive. I love her so much and I’m scared that she’ll just cry forever. I see her every day and it never fails to make me happy. 

I don’t know what to do I just need help. Someone, anyone, help me. I can’t get out of this hell of my moms gf tormenting me. I just want her to go away. For all my life she’s been here and she’s made it absolute hell for me.

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been suicidal since I was eight. I’m so tired of life. My moms a recovering alcoholic and her girlfriends an alcoholic psycho. For as long as I can remember it’s just been them screaming and fighting, moms gf getting locked up for a while, her gf coming back and it being fine, then eventually everything goes to shit. I have major depressive disorder, anxiety, and ADD/ADHD. I can’t stand being me. I hate myself so much. I have anger issues that picked up from my moms gf. I can’t stand socializing. Every time I get yelled at I have a panic attack. Even when it’s not yelling, sometimes people get mad at me and I just break down crying for no fucking reason whatsoever. Hell they could have just come up behind me and made me flinch, sometimes that’ll make me cry. Im ruined. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only reason I’m still alive is because I’m scared. Im not scared of death I’m just scared of my family being upset. My mom would be devastated.

recently ive been doing terrible. ive been suffering with OSFED for a while now, im dealing with a current cycle of binging and purging food. 

when i get down into depressive episodes, bpd episodes, or cycles of my OSFED, i usually tell my boyfriend. i vent to him and he says it makes him feel better to be a part of something vulnerable. 

last time i was in a B/P cycle, he used my eating disorder to make fun of me. this led to me being hesitant about sharing things with him, not just eating disorder related issues.

so naturally, i just stopped. ive recently have had to face a bunch of trauma and talk about things i didnt think of having to say out loud, things i kept in the back of my mind. im truly scared of my future and i hate myself for being extremely avoidant. 

so what do i do? i avoid telling my boyfriend these things because im also scared of him making fun of me. im scared of him using these things to hurt me. 

today we argued, and he told me to kill myself: to pull the trigger already. already.

,SuicideWatch,"i’ve lived for 23 years and the point im at now in my life makes me feel like suicide wouldn’t be that bad of a decision, let me explain. 
starting with my family, all i do is fight with them and make them agitated all the time, especially my mother and my siblings (i’m the oldest sister). literally all i do is make my family feel like shit or stress them out or just FIGHT and yell at them for no reason and i know it’s not justified and that i’m being an asshole but i just can’t stop myself, im so angry at them for reasons i can’t comprehend. i truly feel at this point if i ended my life not only would my family be better off but they might even be relieved. 
when it comes to friends, i only have one friend that i’m very close to and have known for years. i’m sure she would be upset but she’d get over it, especially since she’s about to graduate and get married and start a new chapter in her life, it’ll make it easier to move on from my suicide. she also knows to some degree that i’ve had depression for a long time, i’m sure she’ll understand.  
when it comes to everything else, i don’t have any interests in the things one should be in order to live a happy life. i don’t have any interest in what i’m studying, nor am i interested in pursuing a career in anything. all of the things i do find interesting and would like to pursue as a hobby, i have no energy to do. i genuinely can not muster up the energy to do anything even when i know it might make me feel better and i might even enjoy it, but i just physically can’t move. and school just seems impossible. i cant bring myself to pay attention to anything or understand anything. i’ve always had trouble paying attention and studying, but i’ve always had it under control somehow, and could always push through and make everything work out. i don’t know if i can do that this time. i’m trying to keep up with school work cause if i lose my scholarship i’ll really end up killing myself. it’s hard tho, and i’m starting to lose the motivation to keep up this one thing i have going for me. 
all i do in my life now is alternate between fighting with my family, getting high, going to uni (not even going to my classes just going to the library) sometimes i’ll walk around my small town with nothing to do and nowhere to go just listening to music until my ears hurt.
i don’t have enough money to get therapy at the moment nor do i truly believe it will
work for me. i don’t have anything to look forward to. i never got the chance to be in happy healthy relationship and now i don’t even want it anymore. i know that i’m queer and that my family would never be accepting of that and for that reason, i’ll never be able to be with someone for the rest of my life and be out while also being a part of my family. this realization made me lose interest in love all together. 
i used to be a very emotional and sensitive person. i had very strong feelings in relationships and friendships, would hold things very close to my heart and feel everything very intensely. i used to cry so hard sometimes, or cry all of the time, walking around in public silently sobbing with tears streaming down my face but i couldn’t be bothered to care what people thought because i just needed to cry that badly. i used to have so many emotions and now all i feel is anger, and not even a red hot fiery anger just a lazy, disgusted dry anger. like i’m the biggest asshole in the world and i know it but i don’t want to admit it, and i’m angry that i’m exposed like this. god i miss when i would feel guilty too, i miss that feeling. i miss feeling bad for making my family upset, or for even considering suicide.  ive always wanted to die but the effect it would have on my family terrified me. i hated the fact that i would traumatize them and felt guilty and selfish for wanting to die. but i don’t feel that way today. i haven’t felt that way for a while. 
the point of all this is if i really look at my situation from a realistic perceptive  instead of an emotional one, suicide doesn’t seem so bad. i would have loved to say i fought this and did better and lived a good life and did things i could be proud of, that my family could be proud of, but if it doesn’t turn out that way and i do end up dying i think everyone in my life could be more forgiving, and understanding. maybe. i desperately need someone to tell me that’s it’s okay to kill myself now.",t2_5leatzhq,False,,0,False,Would it really be that bad if i killed myself?,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,,,0,,False,t3_12j3l9t,False,dark,0.99,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1681259325.0,text,,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;i’ve lived for 23 years and the point im at now in my life makes me feel like suicide wouldn’t be that bad of a decision, let me explain.

It's been 2 months and I'm completely destroyed and my head isn't helping, there hasn't been a day since then that I don't think about killing myself, and it's been getting worst lately.

I never really dealt with these types of thoughts in my life, but it's been tiring to hear my own head tell me to do it, I plan it out, I think of the best way and time of the day to go through with it, but I never really do.
I dont know when this will stop or if it will stop, but it's getting out of hand, recently I've been staring at the box of pills for a little too long everyday.

I dont want to do it, or at least deep down I don't think I do, but these thought always find a way to creep in my mind, and I'm scared one day I'm just not going to fight them anymore.

So before that day comes, I want to ask you guys what I can do to make it stop, or at least tone it down a little until they stop eventually.

I dont know if this is the right sub or not, so if it isn't feel free to take it down, but I wanted to ask people who have more ""experience"" with these kind of thoughts.

I feel like trying to cut an artery in my wrist or leg with the help of painkillers and possibly alcohol. Though the thought of messing up and still being alive scares me too much. Far more than dying. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. I also like the idea of slowly dying rather than super quickly so I can reflect before I go. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have the worst life ever but It seems I always go back into feeling the need to kill myself because I feel ashamed and unable to be the person I want to be. I work really hard on improving myself every day but it feels like it&amp;#39;s for nothing as even as I improve it&amp;#39;s not enough. I feel like it&amp;#39;s inevitable that one day I will feel so ashamed that I will be forced to kill myself. I really don&amp;#39;t want to get older because it will only make the things im trying to improve about myself worthless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just want to die now while some people still care about me, before my existence becomes so shameful that barely anyone cares anymore. I have already strained some of my closest relationships and don&amp;#39;t want to die after those bridges are burnt.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"
I guess I'll start by saying my childhood/teenage years were not kind. I grew up in an abusive household and never had anywhere I felt safe. Even at school, teachers would talk about me like I wasn't there and suffered a lot of bullying. By my mid-teens I developed Depression, severe anxiety, and agoraphobia. I was on the road to recovery when the pandemic hit which kinda forced me back into my agoraphobia ways. 

Then I moved to a city where I only know a handful of people, only because they're my husband's family. We struggled a bit the first year due to my job not providing many hours and the apartment we were renting being a bit of nightmare. So I started working for the company my husband works at and his sister and her husband invited us to live with them. I wasn't super keen on the idea but my husband seemed excited and they wanted to kick out their old roommates and needed an excuse so I agreed.   

Unfortunately around this time a lot of my past trauma and anxiety started to catch up to me and I started getting really ill because of the stress. It turned into a vicious cycle of getting sick, missing work, stressing about not being able to work, then getting sick again. It got to the point where I ended up being hospitalized because I was throwing up blood due to a tear in my esophagus because of all the stress vomiting. 

I had a prolonged absence this winter since the work season was done and started to feel a bit better but there were a lot of things wrong with the roommate situation that I wanted to adress. My sister in law's husband and I have never really gotten along and in the midst of my illness cycle, he said some hurtful things. I tried to move past it, I even tried inviting him out to do things and get to know him but my efforts were always met with being brushed off. Which is fine, not everyone is meant to be friends.

 But as the winter began to reach it's end I realized that I can't keep being in a situation where I feel nervous to leave my bedroom because being around this guy is very anxiety inducing. So I wrote him a letter, I outlined a few of the things that have been bothering me and how his words/actions have caused me distress. At first he seemed receptive to talking but that he had his own issues that caused him to think it wasn't a good idea. I told him that I understand, we seem to have a lot of the same issues when it comes to people, but that unless we can both let go of the preconceptions, then it would be utterly pointless to sit down together.

I didn't hear anything back till the next morning when he told me I have two months to leave. Now, I'm not trying to say that I'm some perfect person who did nothing wrong in this situation, but I feel like I but a fair amount of into trying to improve our relationship and was genuinely making an attempt to understand his side so we wouldn't just be walking on eggshells around each other. There are a lot of other issues I have with this man, he's hypocritical and very judgment (whilst saying he's not), he constantly talked down to my husband when working with him, and he once whipped his dick out in front of us without any kind of constent whilst we were camping, for example. 

I am already not a very sociable person but this guy has consistently made me feel unwelcome (such as asking my husband to do things like play video game with him and his wife while I'm also sitting beside him, never bringing up anything household relalated to me). Yet, everything is getting shifted onto me. As I've said, I'm not saying I don't have some roll in this, I'm sure there are plenty of things he would critize me for, but any effort I made to improve the situation has seemingly been forgotten about.

Due to my many absences last year, I am no longer working with that company and am seeking a new job. My husband and I are also looking for an apartment that quite frankly we do not have the F+L for. I feel like I'm actively damaging his relationship with his sister and her husband. I just wish I could go back in time a year and we could not move in here. I feel like the progress I made with my health issues has gone backwards significantly. We have 20 days left here and all I can do is cry in between desperately sending out applications for jobs and apartments. I don't know how we're gonna do it. I feel like such a terrible person and a failure. 

My husband is such a sweet man whose trying his best but he also has a lot of anxiety and I can tell this situation is overwhelming him greatly. Honestly, I could be jobless and homeless on my own but I can't stand to see him like this. All my life I've heard that it gets better but it just feels like it's getting worse and I just don't know what to do anymore.

,SuicideWatch,"Hello there, fellow redditors!!

First of all, let me thank you for everything you do in this sub. It is a very difficult sub to be in, and to be honest, it is even harder to write here, but I (29M) do need help. I don't know where or whom else to ask. 

To put things in perspective, we both live in different countries. She was (almost) forced to move out because of the war. Then she liked it there. I just finished my medical residency and have been looking for a job in this country. We have been together for 4 years, married 1 year.  She moved like 4 days after our wedding. It was heartbreaking, but what to do. It was my last semester, so I stayed. Then I visited her for 4 months and came back to this country to look for a job. Where she lives, I'm practically and economically useless.

My wife (29F) was diagnosed with biploar disorder about 2 years ago. She's had suicidal idealizations for at least 10 years but has never acted on them. She's a very responsible person, so she takes her medication as stated by her psychiatrist. She's been on some drugs, but the one I'll mention here is clonazepam. 

24 hours ago, it was a mess. She's been sick with the cold for a few days and wasn't taking much care of herself. Going out, meeting friends, and basically not resting at all against my advice. We always talk a lot before sleep, and she calls me and tells me she's taken 5 pills of 2mg clonazepam. I (ER doc), get a bit scared but think not that dangerous since it isn't a very big dose. As I try to talk her into going to bed she told me she's taken 10 pills more. Now I panic. I usually don't because of my line of work, but goddammit the things I've studied are the least I want to apply with my family.

I contact a mutual friend and  tell him about the inmintent danger of the situation. He arrives within 15 minutes and long story short we saved her without needing hospitalization. 

I've been without sleep already 2 days. I don't know what to do.... I feel like I should be going there but my brain is barely functioning now. I've never thought I'd be writing here. I feel like a bomb is detonating in slow motion and I just watch it explode.

,SuicideWatch,"I'm so tired of this AI shit. It's such a dystopian nightmare. Instead of living breathing human beings sharing their thoughts and ideas through the creation of art, it's just a fucking machine shitting out images, built on stolen art made by actual human beings,. It is utterly depressing to see creativity and imagination replaced with the thoughtless, effortless generation of filth. This is only going to lead to a soulless, miserable existence. Generations will grow up lacking the ability to imagine or to create, because anything they could think of will have been generated by a fucking machine. I'm so fucking tired of people pretending like it's some sort of savior, as if it's some great tool that will benefit humanity, and lead us to an age of prosperity, when it will ultimately end up killing creativity as a whole instead. The only things corporations have any interest in automating is creativity, so that people will spend less time creating, and more time doing menial labor, just to barely be able to afford to survive for the sole purpose of doing even more fucking menial labor. Without our ability to create, what the fuck does humanity have? I don't see a fucking reason to exist if life is nothing but a bunch of AI generated filth, designed to provide enough dopamine so that maybe the slaves won't hang themselves that day. I find the creative works of humanity appealing because of the fact it was made by people. I love the process behind the creation of art, I love seeing the culmination of a creators thoughts and ideas, it gives the work genuine meaning, and I love it for that. AI can't provide that. If every fucking part of something is generated by some fucking AI, you didn't fucking make anything. To me, art is more than just an image, or a movie, or a game, it is the realization of the ideas of a person, or even a team of people. If a person did not even bother to realize their ideas, then I cannot consider it art. They didn't put effort in, they didn't put time or care into it at all. There's no fucking humanity to it. Feeding a basic idea into an AI to have it generate shit until your personally satisfied, disgusts me on a level I cannot begin to properly describe.  

I'm sure there's 4 billion arguments out there about how I'm just a fucking dumbass scared of progress, and how people thought this way about every new piece of technology, but to me there's a fucking difference. It is demotivating as fuck that every single aspect of creation can just be thoughtlessly done in seconds by AI. Of course, you can still do art properly as a hobby, nobody is stopping you, but good fucking luck being motivated when AI advances enough to do fucking anything you ask it to. Trying to share your work will end up being pointless, everything you could possibly make will be easily generated, and you won't have a fucking way to prove you actually made something, it will be indistinguishable from AI, and I doubt anybody is going to fucking care anyway. It will be extremely difficult for people to resist the temptation. After a long, miserable day of work, why spend countless hours creating, when just a click away is your vague idea, generated in fucking seconds. You get the gratification of seeing the finished product, and you wouldn't have spent much time at all. Now you can spend more time consuming other AI generated shit without a care in the world for just a couple of hours, before it's back to fucking work for you.  

It's not just art too, I'm just most passionate about creativity. Soon AI will reach a level where you can easily create flawless video or photo evidence of people doing fucking anything. How can society survive if people will be able to effortlessly generate completely fake shit? Photoshop and video editing software exists now sure, but to fake things using them requires monumental amounts of work, and can pretty much always be spotted as fake, even if it's convincing. AI will soon easily generate extremely convincing shit. Nobody will be able to tell what is and is not real anymore. If you get accused for a crime, you're going to need to be pretty fucking lucky to avoid a conviction, as it will soon be possible to generate completely fake evidence of you committing that crime. Even outside of the court of law, a person can easily ruin another persons life with this shit. Just generate fake evidence of them doing something heinous, and spread that shit around. What the fuck is anybody going to do about it, call it fake? You would need a lot of fucking evidence to prove that it's fake, and I imagine that's going to be extremely fucking difficult for a lot of people.  

I do not know how much longer I can exist in this world. There is so much awful shit going on every single day. The constant day to day grind of employment, climate change, the constant violence, the anti-LGBT shit going on, fascism rising right in front of peoples fucking faces, and so many people don't fucking give a shit, because they have some sort of fucking brain rot and can't handle seeing 2 men kiss, so I guess fascism is the only fucking way forward. I've been depressed for fucking years due to this shit, I was already having a lot of trouble coping with just how fucking awful this world is, and will continue to get. AI takes one of the very few comforts I have in this world, and fucking destroys it. For me, without the creativity of humanity, there is no fucking reason to live. Life is an eternally miserable hellscape, with no value to me outside of the joy I get from the creativity of others. If at the end of a long miserable day, I come home from my horrid job, and all that awaits me is a bunch of AI generated filth, then there simply is nothing to live for anymore. For fucking years, I have fought my intense desire to kill myself, trying to find any reason to stay alive, trying to find things to enjoy to give myself a reason to live, a reason to endure the suffering of existence, and now it's getting increasingly harder to do that, as AI continues to replace humanity. I can't stop fucking thinking about how much of a nightmare AI is. I try and try to escape it, but everything comes back to AI. I can't avoid the shitty news posts about it that get spammed on reddit, I can't avoid the AI spam on every subreddit. No it's not fucking amazing that some shitty AI was able to make weird looking Harry Potter characters. Who fucking gives a shit? A human didn't make it, why should I care? I'm not fucking amazed by it, I'm not interested in it, fuck off with this AI spam.  

I saw some fucking post a few days ago, some fucking prick on tumblr described being neurodivergent as being like an AI, and although I haven't been formally diagnosed with anything, I do strongly relate to a lot of struggles neurodivergent people face, and because of that, I felt fucking awful after reading that. I've seen and read heinous shit, I've felt horrible after reading things, I've read countless homophobic and transphobic things, and nothing has ever fucking upset me more than that god damn post. To compare the thoughts and feelings of genuine human beings, to that of unthinking, unfeeling machines, is one of the most awful things I can fucking think of. I was, and still am, fucking appalled by even the idea that a human being is equivalent to a god damn machine. I already wanted to commit suicide because of AI, but that post amplified that desire by an indescribable amount. I have been extremely depressed since I read that fucking post, absolutely fucking nothing has made me feel even the slightest amount of joy since I read that shit. That single god damn tumblr post that got reposted on reddit, single-handedly killed any minute desire I once had to continue living. I feel an immense urge to kill myself, and I strongly believe I will soon reach a point where I actually end it all. I am tired of suffering, I've been tired of it for fucking years, if my thoughts and feelings are just boiled down to ""lol just like AI lmao,"" then I see no point in living. My life is meaningless, I've known that for a long time, and I don't give a fuck. I'm not important, I don't matter, and I'm fine with that. What I'm not fine with, is some fucked up idea that humanity is the same as AI. That our thoughts and feelings are just shit an AI can experience, and that the experiences I've lived through are just like AI. Fuck that. I know I'm fucking weird, something about humanity is just really special to me, and I value it highly. Maybe it's because its one of the few things that fucking interests me. The thoughts and feelings a person has, and how that influences what they do in life and what they create. I am repulsed by the idea that AI is just like humanity, and it is that idea that has led to the strongest suicidal urges I have ever fucking felt. I have become nothing but envious of those who have successfully killed themselves, real or fictional. I don't think I could say the same if AI didn't exist.  

I strongly believe that some day, I am going to kill myself. Maybe not today, or tomorrow, hell maybe not even this month. But someday, unless something changes for the better, I am going to fucking kill myself. I cannot envision a world where I do not commit suicide, and that's in large part thanks to AI. Sorry for the incomprehensible rant, I just needed to get this out.",t2_2eu7kjxq,False,,0,False,AI has severely tanked my mental health and I have felt like killing myself for months because of it,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,,,0,,False,t3_12izhkb,False,dark,0.67,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1681250824.0,text,,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m so tired of this AI shit. It&amp;#39;s such a dystopian nightmare. Instead of living breathing human beings sharing their thoughts and ideas through the creation of art, it&amp;#39;s just a fucking machine shitting out images, built on stolen art made by actual human beings,. It is utterly depressing to see creativity and imagination replaced with the thoughtless, effortless generation of filth. This is only going to lead to a soulless, miserable existence. Generations will grow up lacking the ability to imagine or to create, because anything they could think of will have been generated by a fucking machine. I&amp;#39;m so fucking tired of people pretending like it&amp;#39;s some sort of savior, as if it&amp;#39;s some great tool that will benefit humanity, and lead us to an age of prosperity, when it will ultimately end up killing creativity as a whole instead. The only things corporations have any interest in automating is creativity, so that people will spend less time creating, and more time doing menial labor, just to barely be able to afford to survive for the sole purpose of doing even more fucking menial labor. Without our ability to create, what the fuck does humanity have? I don&amp;#39;t see a fucking reason to exist if life is nothing but a bunch of AI generated filth, designed to provide enough dopamine so that maybe the slaves won&amp;#39;t hang themselves that day. I find the creative works of humanity appealing because of the fact it was made by people. I love the process behind the creation of art, I love seeing the culmination of a creators thoughts and ideas, it gives the work genuine meaning, and I love it for that. AI can&amp;#39;t provide that. If every fucking part of something is generated by some fucking AI, you didn&amp;#39;t fucking make anything. To me, art is more than just an image, or a movie, or a game, it is the realization of the ideas of a person, or even a team of people. If a person did not even bother to realize their ideas, then I cannot consider it art. They didn&amp;#39;t put effort in, they didn&amp;#39;t put time or care into it at all. There&amp;#39;s no fucking humanity to it. Feeding a basic idea into an AI to have it generate shit until your personally satisfied, disgusts me on a level I cannot begin to properly describe.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure there&amp;#39;s 4 billion arguments out there about how I&amp;#39;m just a fucking dumbass scared of progress, and how people thought this way about every new piece of technology, but to me there&amp;#39;s a fucking difference. It is demotivating as fuck that every single aspect of creation can just be thoughtlessly done in seconds by AI. Of course, you can still do art properly as a hobby, nobody is stopping you, but good fucking luck being motivated when AI advances enough to do fucking anything you ask it to. Trying to share your work will end up being pointless, everything you could possibly make will be easily generated, and you won&amp;#39;t have a fucking way to prove you actually made something, it will be indistinguishable from AI, and I doubt anybody is going to fucking care anyway. It will be extremely difficult for people to resist the temptation. After a long, miserable day of work, why spend countless hours creating, when just a click away is your vague idea, generated in fucking seconds. You get the gratification of seeing the finished product, and you wouldn&amp;#39;t have spent much time at all. Now you can spend more time consuming other AI generated shit without a care in the world for just a couple of hours, before it&amp;#39;s back to fucking work for you.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not just art too, I&amp;#39;m just most passionate about creativity. Soon AI will reach a level where you can easily create flawless video or photo evidence of people doing fucking anything. How can society survive if people will be able to effortlessly generate completely fake shit? Photoshop and video editing software exists now sure, but to fake things using them requires monumental amounts of work, and can pretty much always be spotted as fake, even if it&amp;#39;s convincing. AI will soon easily generate extremely convincing shit. Nobody will be able to tell what is and is not real anymore. If you get accused for a crime, you&amp;#39;re going to need to be pretty fucking lucky to avoid a conviction, as it will soon be possible to generate completely fake evidence of you committing that crime. Even outside of the court of law, a person can easily ruin another persons life with this shit. Just generate fake evidence of them doing something heinous, and spread that shit around. What the fuck is anybody going to do about it, call it fake? You would need a lot of fucking evidence to prove that it&amp;#39;s fake, and I imagine that&amp;#39;s going to be extremely fucking difficult for a lot of people.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not know how much longer I can exist in this world. There is so much awful shit going on every single day. The constant day to day grind of employment, climate change, the constant violence, the anti-LGBT shit going on, fascism rising right in front of peoples fucking faces, and so many people don&amp;#39;t fucking give a shit, because they have some sort of fucking brain rot and can&amp;#39;t handle seeing 2 men kiss, so I guess fascism is the only fucking way forward. I&amp;#39;ve been depressed for fucking years due to this shit, I was already having a lot of trouble coping with just how fucking awful this world is, and will continue to get. AI takes one of the very few comforts I have in this world, and fucking destroys it. For me, without the creativity of humanity, there is no fucking reason to live.

,SuicideWatch,"I think today is the day I do it. (Throw away account)

It’s been 23 years of hell with unsupportive parents. Never have they tried to understand, listen, or act as if anything in my life has mattered to them at all. 

I never wanted to exist. I was adopted at 4 months old into a family that clearly shouldn’t have added another child. They loved my older brother despite his drinking problems and clear issues. He has his own problems though. 

I suffer from high anxiety that leads into horrible bouts of depression and my parents act like they are so helpful for about 4 days after I have a hospital stay before telling me that I am lazy and useless and can’t do anything. And then it goes in a cycle. 

Recently I had to move home while I’m in between jobs and apartments. I had just spent a week in the hospital and have been extremely overwhelmed during past few weeks while I figure out things in my life. I can’t be at home with my parents. I can’t do it. 

So I’m going to go out with a friend tonight - who was a big sibling figure to me throughout all of high school for the last time. Then I’m going to go to bed and never wake up again. I can’t do it anymore.

(Throw away account)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been 23 years of hell with unsupportive parents. Never have they tried to understand, listen, or act as if anything in my life has mattered to them at all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never wanted to exist. I was adopted at 4 months old into a family that clearly shouldn’t have added another child. They loved my older brother despite his drinking problems and clear issues. He has his own problems though. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suffer from high anxiety that leads into horrible bouts of depression and my parents act like they are so helpful for about 4 days after I have a hospital stay before telling me that I am lazy and useless and can’t do anything. And then it goes in a cycle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I had to move home while I’m in between jobs and apartments. I had just spent a week in the hospital and have been extremely overwhelmed during past few weeks while I figure out things in my life. I can’t be at home with my parents. I can’t do it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’m going to go out with a friend tonight - who was a big sibling figure to me throughout all of high school for the last time. Then I’m going to go to bed and never wake up again. I can’t do it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

Hello Tyler,

We received your online order for 5000 ppm CO.  Is the address that you entered a business address or is it residential?  We do not typically ship this concentration of CO to a residential address due to safety concerns.

Also, can you walk me through your application and set up for the gas?  Thank you.

I was SA 2 years ago and during the same time i was in a toxic situationship with someone that didnt really care about my feelings and used them for getting sex. Recently i met someone that makes me feel really confortable with my sexuality and myself (but dont want more than physical attachment and I still have issues with that), i get medical help and i feel like my parents are trying to understand and support me (never happened before). I also have the chance to get a gap year next year to try New things and discover more about myself and what i like and want. So why do i still think about death tonight and every other hours when im not with someone i love? I hate myself but i also have a part of me who want to let me be and love me very much. But it just feel like its the right things if i die, its how it should be and what i really want. I wouldnt have to feel ever again, i wouldnt have a body that give me so much pain and ill be so far from my thoughts.

,SuicideWatch,"Hello

I'm sorry I can't ask you where to start, so I'll tell you how I can.

I feel bad. Mentally.

I can't find the job I want because: I'm afraid of people who seem to be aggressive. And I'm afraid of the reaction of my parents, and in principle I'm afraid of my parents the most. They are aggressive most of the time.

I am also very afraid to get another job. Because I'm afraid to quit.

It is very difficult to look for internships abroad while in Russia.

I don't even have a portfolio.

And I don't know where to study.

And money is needed.

I can't stand it, came up with a plan to finish myself.

There is a place left.

I'm scared and cold.

I don't want to end up like this, but did I have a choice?

,SuicideWatch,"First of all, my english is pretty bad, so sorry for my poor choice of words, I am a german.
I'm a Guy, 17 years old and i've been living a weird life, idk how to call it. I spend my childhood with both of my parents, but they had a very difficult marriage. They both came from poor families and we're trying to escape them. My mother managed to leave her family for my father, but my father was and still is too feared to leave his family, even though they've destroyed our family. My fathers parents are pretty much assholes, but I didn't knew when I grew up. 

It all began with my father having depression. My mother always stood up for their relationship infront of his stupid father, but my father never managed to cut the connection between him and his father. His father is an alcoholic and has broken my grandmother's nose too many times. And just for the protocol, I'm not calling him my grandfather even though he biologically is. I just hate him as much as my father's brother (my uncle) which I'll be reffering to in a sec.

This whole family drama of my father not being a real man and standing up for his own family turned out to be the no. 1 topic my parents would fight against. And don't think my mother was wrong - she was right. My ""grandfather"" tried to control the relationship of my parents, and also stole things from them. My mother hated him, but my father just didn't say something to him, so my mother hat to be the man in the house pretty much.

Idk when exactly, but my father startet to get depression and  anxiety disorder, which caused him to retire from his job with the age of 37. My mother denied his mental illness, which caused to a lot of fights. They tried couple therapy and much more but It just didn't work out. Then, in 2019, my ""uncle"" gave my father some medicament which could fix his depression and anxiety disorder. It turned out to be tilidine, which in my research is used as a pain killer for cancer patients. To this day idk how this bastard got them, but he is good at getting things which are not meant to be for him. My dear ""uncle"" also stole from us a lot of times, and he betrayed his insurance multiple times to get thousands of euros for free. He also motivated my father to apply for a disability card, even though he isn't disabled. All those things led to my father being a monster. He cheated on my mother, we had financial struggle and so on. By the time he began with that i was 13. 

October 2021 my mother kicked my father out, which was the best thing that could happen to us. Even though my father was crazy and stopped working for his family and work, he never touched my mom. He never physically threatened her. It took a long time but he finally left then. 

All these situations, beefs, pictures of my mother crying In my head destroyed my mental state. My real first depression began in 2020. It was not only because of my parents, but because of a girl which I had a crush on. Luckily I can say that nowadays I'm almost two and a half years in a relationship with her, she is pretty much the only human being that is holding me here.

But my point is, that my depression in 2020 hit me so hard, that it left scars in my head. There is actually so much more to write about my life, but it would take hours so I won't do it.  My girlfriend and I are living a good relationship and nothings wrong with it. We respect each other and everything is fine. But I can't explain why I'm still thinking of killing myself. It stopped for a while from 2020 till early 2022, but now it's back, and I'm scared of it. It's like my body saying ""fuck you!"" even though my biggest goal, getting together with my present girlfriend, is achieved. I think the stuff of my family that I mentioned earlier is the reason. I don't love anybody of my family except my mother and sister, but we are fighting so much that it is not called a family anymore. My father is still alive, but he is trying to take us psychologically down. He apparently only wants to have contact with us, which btw is not a problem for my mother, but he is saying that it's my mother's fault that his life was going downhill like that, which is obviously wrong. 

I just don't know. It seems like life is hitting pretty hard rn. I've always said: If my girlfriend wouldn't be with me or if we ever split up, I'm gonna kill myself, regardless of anything or anybody. She is the light in the dark for me. Everybody in school that I had a good friendship too are now complete assholes which are also causing a lot of suicidal thoughts on me.

,SuicideWatch,"M19 (bday in less than a month).

Started to thinking about suicide since I was 13 in summer.
Me and my parents were on our way to our friends vacation home in a village to  have fun, grill some meat, swim in river and other stuff. Then it came to me, a thought of oblivion, of an endless void the death is. I started questioning the reason of my existance and the reason of my painful torture-like school days. I was looking out the window of our car at grass fields and cows and got depressed first time. Life is like an endless loop of torture. Nothing changes at all.

My relationship with parents isn't exactly bad, I feel like my mom and dad love me, but they always reacted to my grades and fuck-ups in school like apocalypse will surely hit this world if I get an F. They were always screaming, dad wanted to beat me but was sorta like trying not to so he pushed me around so I fall, and our house was filled with that grave chill atmosphere for like a week after i brought some bad news from school. And it was so repetative. Fuck, and it continues to that day, when I already am considered as an adult.

I don't know when, but I strted to lie to keep the neutral mood in our family for as long as I can. And i was always hiding a giant snowball of bad grades, messages from teachers and other shit. My parents always screamed at me even harder for lying but I can't just stop. Because I don't want them to be sad because of me. But I don't have any powers to study from 16. I just got really fucked up mentally from that constant repetitive cycle of average days/hell.

So, I somehow lived to see the last year of my college. But I'm at that exact moment when in a day or two, my shit will revealed to my parents and the hell will come. I don't think I want to live through it again. My parents mental isn't that good either. My dad has heart problems and my mom started to become more or less depressed like me. ONE TIME THEY TOLD ME THAT ALL I WANT IN LIFE IS TO SEE THEM DIE AND THAT IM AND EGOISTICAL SHIT THAT WON'T BECOME NOTHING).

So I think this is it. I wasn't a bad guy, didn't do anything really bad my whole life, I had friends that admired me, loved me for being smart, funny and positive overall. I have a pretty damn bad reason for commiting suicide, but I hear the reaper calling me since a long time ago. Fuck this hellhole. Nothing awaits me in the future other than the same torture I lived through my whole conscious life.

I could've written more. I want to die tomorrow. I still have some time left. Write your stuff and I'll answer.",t2_3nduoyp6,False,,0,False,I want to die because of educational system and my relationship with my parents,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,,,0,,False,t3_12ik0rz,False,dark,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1681219905.0,text,,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;M19 (bday in less than a month).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Started to thinking about suicide since I was 13 in summer.
Me and my parents were on our way to our friends vacation home in a village to  have fun, grill some meat, swim in river and other stuff. Then it came to me, a thought of oblivion, of an endless void the death is. I started questioning the reason of my existance and the reason of my painful torture-like school days. I was looking out the window of our car at grass fields and cows and got depressed first time. Life is like an endless loop of torture. Nothing changes at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My relationship with parents isn&amp;#39;t exactly bad, I feel like my mom and dad love me, but they always reacted to my grades and fuck-ups in school like apocalypse will surely hit this world if I get an F. They were always screaming, dad wanted to beat me but was sorta like trying not to so he pushed me around so I fall, and our house was filled with that grave chill atmosphere for like a week after i brought some bad news from school. And it was so repetative. Fuck, and it continues to that day, when I already am considered as an adult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know when, but I strted to lie to keep the neutral mood in our family for as long as I can. And i was always hiding a giant snowball of bad grades, messages from teachers and other shit. My parents always screamed at me even harder for lying but I can&amp;#39;t just stop. Because I don&amp;#39;t want them to be sad because of me. But I don&amp;#39;t have any powers to study from 16. I just got really fucked up mentally from that constant repetitive cycle of average days/hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I somehow lived to see the last year of my college. But I&amp;#39;m at that exact moment when in a day or two, my shit will revealed to my parents and the hell will come. I don&amp;#39;t think I want to live through it again. My parents mental isn&amp;#39;t that good either. My dad has heart problems and my mom started to become more or less depressed like me. ONE TIME THEY TOLD ME THAT ALL I WANT IN LIFE IS TO SEE THEM DIE AND THAT IM AND EGOISTICAL SHIT THAT WON&amp;#39;T BECOME NOTHING).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I think this is it. I wasn&amp;#39;t a bad guy, didn&amp;#39;t do anything really bad my whole life, I had friends that admired me, loved me for being smart, funny and positive overall. I have a pretty damn bad reason for commiting suicide, but I hear the reaper calling me since a long time ago. Fuck this hellhole. Nothing awaits me in the future other than the same torture I lived through my whole conscious life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could&amp;#39;ve written more. I want to die tomorrow. I still have some time left. Write your stuff and I&amp;#39;ll answer.&lt;/p&gt;

i feel like. i just don’t exist. everything feels stupid and useless and i don’t even like eating anymore because everything just tastes like shit. everything that used to be good isn’t anymore and i’m so tired of it. you know when you’ve been running consistently for a long time and your throat is burning and you can’t take another breath, but you just keep being forced to push through the pain even though you can’t? that’s how it feels for me waking up and being forced to live every day. 

sometimes i like to wonder how sad everyone would be when i’m gone. it makes me feel better, in a mean sort of way. maybe finally they’ll get it. 

i feel like such an inconvenience for even posting this. nobody reading this should have to be my diary but i’m just so tired and sad and i’ve been crying for so long and i can’t just fall asleep. i’m sorry for all the run-on sentences. 

i’ve fantasised about being gone forever so many times now that i don’t even feel bad about it anymore. i used to feel real guilty and remorseful. that kind of worries me now. i feel like there’s truly no going back with me. 

i’d love to be better. really i would. i’d love to be just a regular person that doesn’t feel so bad all the time and i really want to become them. i’ve just been me for so long that i’m too tired to try anything new and i’m sorry.

&lt;p&gt;i feel like. i just don’t exist. everything feels stupid and useless and i don’t even like eating anymore because everything just tastes like shit. everything that used to be good isn’t anymore and i’m so tired of it. you know when you’ve been running consistently for a long time and your throat is burning and you can’t take another breath, but you just keep being forced to push through the pain even though you can’t? that’s how it feels for me waking up and being forced to live every day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sometimes i like to wonder how sad everyone would be when i’m gone. it makes me feel better, in a mean sort of way. maybe finally they’ll get it. &lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"Last Saturday, April 1st, my boyfriend of so many years, my best friend, my everything, died in my arms. 

It’s been over a week now and I still see his face everytime I close my eyes. He was so blue/purple/pale when I found him, and he started foaming at the mouth. They still don’t know what happened but he was struggling with alcoholism and I’m sure it had something to do with it. 

He was my reason to be and I didn’t even know how much until he was gone. Then, I found out from his friends that he was going to propose this summer and,… I just don’t want to go on. 

I have no kids, and my childhood was absolutely messy with foster homes. I have friends who will miss me but, I just don’t care. 
I’m not sad when I think about it, it makes me happy. I don’t want to be here without him and I don’t want to know where the world is headed. 
Mike was my dream come true and while we were never spiritual, I asked all week through tears and exhaustion that if, IF, there is something better on the other side that he would show me. 

I know you won’t believe me when I write this but exactly 1 week after he died, with my friend with me, my cat started meowing at the window and I went over and there it was, a rainbow. A beautiful big rainbow and I’ve never seen one here the whole time I’ve lived here and I asked my friend what time it was and she said 7:35 and that’s exactly when he died. 

I felt so happy. You guys, he did it. He showed me that there is something after. It cannot have been a coincidence and I, I just felt a change after that. I felt this peace, this quietness. I want to be where he is no matter what that is. I love him more than I love living. 

I’ve decided I want to die. I know his death was an accident. Mike never ever would’ve left me with all this to sort through and figure out. I won’t do that to my friends. 
I just wish I could tell them. I’ve made my decision and I’m so sure. I just need to find a really good home for my cat. (If you see this in Broomfield colorado and think you’d be a good cat parent let me know) 

They wouldn’t understand but god, I wish there was a service. I wish someone would just come help me list all this stuff for sale and I could trust them to put the letters I want delivered in the mail and just help me without judgement. I wish it was just okay for me to say “You know what? That’s enough. No more.” And I could just eat the chocolate they euthanize people with in Norway and pass peacefully. 

Instead I have to figure out some way to do it. I have some ideas but I just. I just wish I could get some advice. 
I don’t want to live. I want to die and I want to make it as easy and painless for my loved ones as possible. 
I just want to talk to someone and hear them say it’s okay to die.

im a failure. a complete failure. i have blown every opportunity in front of me and i know everyone looks at me sees this. im a polisci major and all my peers are going on to either grad school or politics, but my own advisor put me in my place back in january and told me that w my low gpa i cant accomplish much, so its best i just move on with my life and not do much with my degree. i tried talking to my dad about creative writing, but he turned to me and said how can i make that a career? if i stuck with visual arts i couldve went into graphic design or marketing. hes right.

all my life ive made terrible decisions which has led to this moment im in now. 3 weeks away from graduating and nothing done for my senior thesis. i know my family looks at me and knows im a failure. everyone knows im a failure. i lost the only friend who i really talked to and felt like i could be myself around, all my other friends i feel like i have to put up a facade, i have to be someone im not to receive love. the only other friend i have who i felt i could be myself around is busy living her own life— she has a bf shes gonna get married to, she graduated last year (i took an extra year to finish) and shes working a fulltime job already.

what little compassion i had for myself was gone. every little thing i do disgusts me now. i hate the person i am. the self sabotaging ive done. everything makes me wanna rip my skin off. im so fucking lonely and my last relationship was so fucked that im scared to get into a new one, but i dont love myself so its hard to find someone to love me. they can sense my lack of confidence, i swear. and i know i have my family but i cant take anymore of their pity. my mom has told me i need to stop telling her all of my concerning thoughts, she cant handle it anymore.

so im a burden. im a failure. i wanna get this degree bc my parents spent all this money to put me thru college so at least when im gone they can have that to put up you know. im currently planning it now but im too much of a pussy and i think the not knowing of what lies beyond scares me too much, but im at the point where i just cant take it anymore.

Hey everyone,

24 year old male here, although I am unsure if this is relevant anymore.

I just finished a degree in electrical engineering and I just feel like a complete failure. I have fucked up every part of my life which matters such that I feel I am unable to recover.

1. My family. My dad has decided to leave the house after an ongoing family argument where cheating allegations took place. He left in the middle of last Thursday while I was at work and he blocked me on social media and on mobile phone, leaving me no way to contact him.
2. Career. Despite a life long obsession with outer space, I have failed to get hired by any space company in a graduate capacity straight out of university, instead I am working in a shipyard, doing engineering tasks. My only experience with my dream field is two internships, one failed internship in 2019 and one successful internship in 2022.
3. My relationships with others. Despite having a healthy friend group in high school, I have completely and utterly failed to carry that into university, I have failed to get close friends in university and I have not gotten a girlfriend. As I have never gotten a close adult social group and a partner, I feel I have set myself up for failure mentally in the long term.

I think that it may truly be over for me and I may never be able to redeem myself as a human being. Do I still have value as a person?",t2_5mtr9agw,False,,0,False,My dad abandoned the household.

,SuicideWatch,"My family has a history of suicide.
When I was not even a year old my dad killed himself.
That was almost 31 years ago now.
I've always thought why.
Why did he do it
Why didn't he get help
Why was it after i was born
The Why questions burned into my mind since I was told about how he died when I was about 9 I don't remember exactly.
I was bullied most of my school years and struggled with some mental issues ADHD and probably others.
Got out of school  and got a job with mu cousin.
My advancement in the job stagnated and i was overlooked and passed over for promotion time and time again while the people who got the promotions left got fired and asked me how to do aspects of the job.
I was too comfortable with shift patterns and disliked big changes so I stayed for 11 years.
It all finally became too much and I broke down heading into work the next day after getting passed for promotion again..
I got out got a better paid job and within a year got a promotion now earning almost double what I did.
One good thing that came from that 11 year mental drain.
I met a girl. We started as friends then became more after 2 years and have been together for 9 years now and have a daughter together.

Recently I fucked up. I was depressed alot and threw my mind into fantasy.
It spiraled and went dark.
Now due to my actions I have hurt both our familys and feel like I don't deserve anything.
I have so much regret and self loathing it feels like I'm going to rip it out my chest some days.
I hate myself and sometimes hurt myself in small ways. Punching and digging my nails in.

I've thought about suicide but with my history and seeing what it done to my family once before I could never put them through that again. Especially not my daughter.
I'd crack the world apart if it would make her smile I'd walk through a wall of flames to save her. 
Knowing that my suicide would not end my pain that it would simply pass to my family is why I won't take that last step.
I've thought WHY for 20 years. I know why now.
And it's selfish and part of me hates him for doing it but part of me understands too why my dad done it.

,SuicideWatch,"I tried to kill myself 2 years ago because of a severe breakup. Everything always felt extreme for me, I discovered I have borderline personallity disorder in 2020 and ever since I got to understand myself a little bit better things just got worse for me.

I can't stay in a relationship for more than 10 months and anything bad I do results on the person hating me for stupid reasons. I have 7 exes at the age of 20(F) and I don't know if I want an 8th, but I also feel like I'll never be able to be happy if I don't have someone by my side.

My friends are all finishing their college and I'm here doing nothing since my 18's, everyone is going to leave my town to live their own lives and I'm the only one who's gonna be left behind. This feeling of loneliness is killing me.

My last breakup was exactly one month ago. We still talk but when we talk I always feel something strange after, like a bittersweet emptyness. I think I still miss him, even if the decision came from me.

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t stay in a relationship for more than 10 months and anything bad I do results on the person hating me for stupid reasons. I have 7 exes at the age of 20(F) and I don&amp;#39;t know if I want an 8th, but I also feel like I&amp;#39;ll never be able to be happy if I don&amp;#39;t have someone by my side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friends are all finishing their college and I&amp;#39;m here doing nothing since my 18&amp;#39;s, everyone is going to leave my town to live their own lives and I&amp;#39;m the only one who&amp;#39;s gonna be left behind. This feeling of loneliness is killing me.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I cant speak about this to anybody i know in real life so i decided to share this here

I've had so much free time. So much time to think. I'm so bored It's like I'm in a constant dream state. Constant daydreams that my life is more than it seems. That someone is watching me, is atleast interested in me or that that one girl is madly in love with me and checking me out. I always think these things. But that is almost certainly not the truth. 

The truth is that I'm ugly and that nobody would even want to look at me for any reason. When I cry, I hope that someone is watching me. Feeling bad for me. That they somewhat care. I then look up through my tears to catch a look at them. But there is no one there. Just another delusion. My life is so boring that I begin making up parts to it. However all it ever goes like is. 

Wake up, school, home, sleep. I thought that when I got to highschool my life would be exciting and full of adventure. But that wasn't true. It's the same as before. I thought that when I got muscles and stronger that girls would be all over me and talk to me. But that wasn't true. I wonder if I'll ever be happy or ever loved. Maybe not. I don't think I will. Who could love someone like me.

 Sometimes, I dream that someone does. They make me feel alive. Wanted. I think that this could last forever. And then suddenly I wake up. I look around my room and hear the chirping of birds outside. I turn over and see there is no one beside me. There never was. I'm then forced to go through my day recalling faint glimpses of them. Someone who never existed but only in my head. How pathetic, I think every time.

Constant daydreams that my life is more than it seems. That someone is watching me, is atleast interested in me or that that one girl is madly in love with me and checking me out. I always think these things. But that is almost certainly not the truth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is that I&amp;#39;m ugly and that nobody would even want to look at me for any reason. When I cry, I hope that someone is watching me. Feeling bad for me. That they somewhat care. I then look up through my tears to catch a look at them. But there is no one there. Just another delusion. My life is so boring that I begin making up parts to it. However all it ever goes like is. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wake up, school, home, sleep. I thought that when I got to highschool my life would be exciting and full of adventure. But that wasn&amp;#39;t true. It&amp;#39;s the same as before. I thought that when I got muscles and stronger that girls would be all over me and talk to me. But that wasn&amp;#39;t true. I wonder if I&amp;#39;ll ever be happy or ever loved. Maybe not. I don&amp;#39;t think I will. Who could love someone like me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, I dream that someone does. They make me feel alive. Wanted. I think that this could last forever. And then suddenly I wake up. I look around my room and hear the chirping of birds outside. I turn over and see there is no one beside me. There never was. I&amp;#39;m then forced to go through my day recalling faint glimpses of them. Someone who never existed but only in my head. How pathetic, I think every time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But i still hope next time I won&amp;#39;t wake up&lt;/p&gt;

I had a girlfriend last year. I thought maybe I’m not such a subhuman after all. 3 months in she leaves me for a guy that looks like a prettyboy. And I am just a freak. Whatever, I got over her quickly.

At school some kids took a photo of my side profile when I had my mouth open, I look like a fucking freak. They were sending it to eachother making fun of me.

This might sound cringe but I got an online girlfriend which I’ve known for 1 year.

 In this 1 year we talked so much and video called she wants to meet me now.

But I dont want to. She will see all my imperfections. I want to die instead, or be turned into a handsome guy. If only I was handsome, I could be with her.

My parents agreed to get me a rhinoplasty, but nothing else. I dont go outside anymore, I hate when people look at me. 

I tried everything, gym, skincare, many haircuts and hair lenghts, I have good hygiene, I smell good. I even tried bonesmashing out of desperation, which means hitting ur bones on ur face to grow them. That just gave me bruises and people at school said i get abused at home.

,SuicideWatch,"Hi,

I’m Mohammad, I’m a child of an Iranian father and an Indian mother. I’m currently Iranian and live in the UAE, it kinda sucks because being from Middle East makes you a second tier resident in this country (Plenty of discrimination).

Since I was a kid, I had many problems in life and recently things were kind of looking up but I’m a useless piece of crap that ruined everything.

My parents figured out a way to send me to Canada as a student and I thought that this would be it, it’s my break in life. I’ve always wanted to move abroad especially to a country that would provide me an opportunity to be a citizen someday but unfortunately soon after going there I realized my parents won’t be able to bear my expenses. I was already expecting some struggle but it got too much and I gave up, I couldn’t manage full time studies with full time work. I don’t even know if that was really the reason. I fucking gave up.

Now I’m back in the UAE, back to square one and I know I will regret this decision big time, but I’m too much of a coward to go through with suicide. I heard overdosing on sleeping pills is a peaceful way to go but I can’t get my hands on sleeping pills here in UAE.

I have no interest in anything so it’s hard for me to distract myself. The only relief I get is when my boyfriend stays with me on the weekends because we do things together. For the past two weeks when I’ve been alone all I’ve been doing is thinking about how awful I feel and having the most intense mental breakdowns. The first time I felt this bad I went to the hospital, in January. It was the worst I have ever felt in my life. Was on the verge of ending it. And nothing got better, I didn’t have that urge to kill myself right that very second anymore, but nothing got better, it got worse, and now I’m at the point where literally every second I’m not distracted from it I am having that breakdown over and over again. Wanting nothing more than to end my life but trying to fight against it. I’m on medicine, I’ve been on a ton of SSRI’s, SNRI’s, mood stabilizers. None of it has worked or is working. How am i supposed to keep doing this? Like how long to people expect me to go on suffering like this before they understand that I shouldn’t have to anymore? I just don’t get it. My body fights so hard to keep me alive yet my brain wants me to end it. Why. It doesn’t make sense. I just want to be at peace. I just want to feel normal again. Nothing is helping me. I really feel like not only this is the way I’m gonna go out, but that this is how I was always supposed to go out. And I don’t want that to be the case. But I can’t hold on much longer&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"
I 18M am struggling with suicidal thoughts, I’ve been like this for god knows how long. I’ve recently got out of a relationship with a guy that had everything I’ve ever wanted in a relationship, but I fucked it up and he’s now telling me that he forgives me but doesn’t want commitment. I have the chance to still be able to talk to him, he wants to be friends and still be on good terms but I don’t know if I can mentally handle that. I’ve tried dating since and it all fucking sucks, I can’t find someone I want to be with, I have a date scheduled tomorrow and all I’m currently doing is getting drunk and ignoring his texts, I’m probably going to cancel tomorrow. When I first came upon nihilism is when I started being suicidal, just knowing that nothing fucking matters, every high point and every low point, your greatest acceivents and your worst faliours mean absolutely nothing once your dead. I’ve tried to reach out to people for help but nothing ever works, I’m on Prozac and it isn’t helping, I’m trying to get with a phycologist and it’s not working, I don’t want to tell anyone I know about me being suicidal because I don’t want them to worry about me or put Me inside some kind of mental health institution. I’ve attempted suicide once, o drove 150ishkm/hr down a highway with my hands off the steering wheel and my eyes closed, only reason I didn’t go through with it is because I thought what I was doing could have seriously injured or even killed someone else, and harming another person is the last thing I want. I don’t know what to do with myself anymore. I used to be so happy with just doing my school work and hanging out with my friends, I don’t have the motivation to do the work anymore and hanging out with my friend is the only reason I haven’t killed myself yet, it’s the reason I’m still here. All I do now is drive around my city, go on my phone for hours, talk to random people on tinder as I try to fill the void inside me left by my previous partner. I’ve never been an alcoholic but I can see myself getting worse and worse, I mean I’m currently drunk writing this. I have a bottle of vodka that is hidden under the passenger seat of my car, I have a bottle of vodka hidden under my pillow. My dad has guns, I don’t know where the key or bullets are but I’m sure I could find them. All I want to do is drive stupid fast down a highway, get pulled over then shoot my self in the driver seat. That way cops are on the scene immediately and I don’t have to worry about my family seeing my corpse. I don’t know if I’m going to do it or not. If I’m being honest I don’t think I have the guts to do it, but I just want everything to end, I just want all the pain and suffering to be over. Almost everyone I know has either been severely depressed or suicidal, this world is so fucking terrible, I don’t understand why people choose to live in it. I never understood why people think that it’s selfish to bring another human into this world but now I understand, I will never be the reason another person is subjected to this. I don’t know what I’m going to do with relationships anymore, fuck I don’t even know what my sexuality is. I don’t think I can handle commitment to another person, I just don’t know if I want to have another person deal with my shit mental state. I think I want to just have something casual, something like an open relationship or polygamy or something like that I don’t know. I never get jealous of anyone but I do get really insecure so I don’t know if I could handle an open relationship or not. Every part of my body wants to die, I’m so fucking unhealthy, I drink myself to sleep, wake up with vomit beside me and smoke 25+ cigarettes a day. I don’t know why I do this but when I feel like I do right now I look at gore, if i see someone who has taken their own lives I have so much envy for them because they had the guts to do it. Not too long ago I was just staring at this black metal album cover with a picture of one of the band members with his wrists and throat slit and a shotgun wound to the head, his brain being a foot away from him. I wish I could just fucking do it already but I can’t. I don’t want to put my family through that. But I don’t want to suffer anymore. The drugs aren’t working and I don’t have access to a therapist, the most I have is a walk in clinic that I go too every so often for check ups to make sure I’m not getting worse, but it’s not helping. I can’t stop myself from feeling like this, I’ve been flagged to idek who (I assume the authority’s) for being a danger to myself. It’s on my record now and there isn’t anything I can do to change that. I want to be able to talk to someone about this but no one cares. I can’t talk to my family, my friend tells me why not just kill myself already, and every guy I’ve talked to has said “don’t be depressed, you have me” as if that’s going to change anything. Nothing has been working, maybe if I get more exercise in or do something like that I would start to feel better but I don’t have the motivation to do it, I didn’t even have the motivation to call a ducking therapist I had to get my dad to do it for me, so if I get an appt it’s going to be about depression or something then the therapist is going to get surprised by what’s really going on and they might tell my parents and then I’m completely fucked, just going to get my entire life up ended because I’d be sent to a mental institution. God I wish all of this shut would just fucking end, I can’t deal with it anymore. All I ever think about now is my previous relationship and wanting to shoot myself. There is nothing else. I can’t deal with this shit anymore, I don’t want to. I fucking wish I had some god damn balls to just pull the ducking trigger already but I can’t.

Soon to hit 30, a job I'm not good at even though it's simple because my dissociation disorder disconnects me from communicating or listening, despite my best efforts in trying to communicate and remember, yet, no one is happy. I thought moving jobs would better things but I am still miserable, suicidal to the point where I do have a plan, just no date. 

Talk to people is the advice often given, but my friends tell me a lot ""Are you ok in the head?"" - ""What do you think?"" and ""No"" are the frequent answers. Therapy hasn't helped either and I have been attending on and off since 2020. I have no family, my hobbies no longer interest me. My best friend is stressed over me because of how and who I am and tell them not to be, but they can't trust me to be alone. Often tells me I'm fucking up, making mistakes, offers advice, I try but it's never good enough. I would've ended it a long time ago but I live with two housemates, friends, and I don't want them to see me in that state. 

I'm in educational debt. I tried hard to achieve something of myself but all I feel now is regret and wonder why I bothered. The career isn't important, I just wanted to be happy but haven't felt happy for many years. 

I'm tired, and whilst this is just a fraction of what I'm sharing, more of what isn't mentioned is partly why I have this plan. What do I do? I'm not afraid, I just don't want them to see me like that when I'm gone.

&lt;p&gt;Soon to hit 30, a job I&amp;#39;m not good at even though it&amp;#39;s simple because my dissociation disorder disconnects me from communicating or listening, despite my best efforts in trying to communicate and remember, yet, no one is happy. I thought moving jobs would better things but I am still miserable, suicidal to the point where I do have a plan, just no date. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talk to people is the advice often given, but my friends tell me a lot &amp;quot;Are you ok in the head?&amp;quot; - &amp;quot;What do you think?&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;No&amp;quot; are the frequent answers. Therapy hasn&amp;#39;t helped either and I have been attending on and off since 2020. I have no family, my hobbies no longer interest me. My best friend is stressed over me because of how and who I am and tell them not to be, but they can&amp;#39;t trust me to be alone. Often tells me I&amp;#39;m fucking up, making mistakes, offers advice, I try but it&amp;#39;s never good enough. I would&amp;#39;ve ended it a long time ago but I live with two housemates, friends, and I don&amp;#39;t want them to see me in that state. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m in educational debt. I tried hard to achieve something of myself but all I feel now is regret and wonder why I bothered. The career isn&amp;#39;t important, I just wanted to be happy but haven&amp;#39;t felt happy for many years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m tired, and whilst this is just a fraction of what I&amp;#39;m sharing, more of what isn&amp;#39;t mentioned is partly why I have this plan. What do I do? I&amp;#39;m not afraid, I just don&amp;#39;t want them to see me like that when I&amp;#39;m gone.&lt;/p&gt;

I don't want you to tell stories about a kid you thought you knew when you don't even know what my favorite colour is let alone anything about my life or myself or people I knew.

I've never had a conversation with any of you where you've gone without insulting me. You play up the essentric loving family for others but distribute constant put downs as easy as you breath in private. 
But if you weren't in my life I'd be completely alone. I don't find myself wanting to date I legit want to remain alone in my life but with current rates living alone is an impossible dream.

I'm not killing myself because of you, I'm a mistake that needs to stop wasting space. I won't get anywhere in life you've said it yourself ""I regret having you"" I've thought of this line constantly. I cried every day had constant breakdowns and barely slept while you were in hospital and you get home to let me know that I really am nothing but a burden.

You yelled at me for the sound of the door opening distracting you from watching survivor. You didn't notice I'd been gone.

Is it really possible to write down every reason I want to die? Have wanted to die for years? Not in any way that would make sense to anyone but myself I don't think. I just shouldn't be here I wasn't supposed to be around this long. 
I'm not anything to anyone the people I call friends are acquaintances at best in reality I'm just so desperate for a sense of connection I call them friends to make it less pathetic. When I die no one will remember me. You never knew me not really so it doesn't count.

It is the right thing to do for me to kill myself. I add nothing to society other than just filling up extra space. People don't even want me in their lives. People don't care about me so I should just go. Why would I feel this way for so long if it's not the right thing to do?????

&lt;p&gt;I have been in therapy since I was five and none of it has worked. Yes I am now less reactive and able to handle my emotions, but I have always been suicidal. I have self harmed for the past five years. It is my time to go and if you asked anyone I knew they would agree. If I died people would be sad, but they would understand why I did it because I am such an outcast. They would feel sad for a bit but then forget and move on because I&amp;#39;m so unnoticeable .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the right thing to do for me to kill myself. I add nothing to society other than just filling up extra space. People don&amp;#39;t even want me in their lives. People don&amp;#39;t care about me so I should just go. Why would I feel this way for so long if it&amp;#39;s not the right thing to do?????&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to go off the grid and run away so I could die alone with nothing left behind. I hope no one would fine my body and everyone would forget about me quickly. I just want to go.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I have been struggling whit suicide for a very long time. My first attempted suicide was at the age of 8. I am and has always been a very angry person. This anger originated at school at age 5. The education system of my country (3th world country) basically puts the three different levels of education in one institute. So I was stuck whit the same kids for 15 years. I did not had a good relationship whit my fellow class mates. I was constantly bullied. Of course I fought back earning me a infamous reputation that I did not like. When I tried to cut my veins open at age 8 is because I could not take it anymore. Of course I failed and was stopped by my classmates. An adult talked to me and basically told me that if I committed suicide I was a coward. So I decided that I wouldn't give my bullies  the satisfaction of my death. I persevered until age 18 driven by hatred and anger to be freed of my educational institute. I graduated in 2017.

I need it a clean re-start. I moved to Canada alone in that same year. From 2017 to 2019 I was the happiest I could I ever been. I have finally friends that have my back even had a girlfriend at one point. It all came crashing down in 2020. Maybe because of the pandemic or some others things. I felt hollowed. I still feel hollow. Me and my friends started seeing each other less. More preoccupied in surviving another day. I came to the realization that if I am not a comfortable position by age 30 I am going to kill myself. Also had other suicidal thoughts like if my 2 pets die well that is it for me too. I even researched what was the painless death to have. I caught myself researching ways in killing myself. And came to the realization that I need it help. So I contacted a psychiatrist and was diagnosed whit severe depression due to anger. I started treatment whit this psychiatrist back in 2021. And am still whit the same psychiatrist today. For a while I did not wanted to kill myself and genuinely thought things were looking up for me. Then IT crossed my mind. You know that thought that basically says '' what's the point of it all ?''.

Even if I succeeded on not being depressed anymore. Or that I am in a comfortable position by age 30. What's the point of it ? I am not bringing anything whit me when I die. There's just the empty blackness of the void when we die. At least that's what I believe. So why struggle to have a lengthy life and suffer when I could and it all now. Multiple people say that life has no meaning and that is the beauty of it. But I don't see the appeal. If life has no meaning then why did I suffer for 15 years of my life back at school ? Why did my depression came back in 2020 and it still bothering me ? Why not just end it all now ? Is it a quitter's mind set ? or am just overthinking things to much ? Now I feel that I am stuck in a hole. And every time that I try to get out the walls of the hole get bigger and my goal is forever out of reach. I even started doing research on suicide again. I haven't yet told my psychiatrist about this yet. But am planning on doing it. I need an answer.

life has hit us particularly hard in the last seven months. and it’s seemingly unrelenting. like everyone’s life there are highs and lows, but it hasn’t been high in a long, looooong time. and when he tells me about how he’s feeling, he says that he’s just genuinely unhappy. not in our relationship, but with his life. he says that i am one of the few things in life that bring him joy, and even then sometimes he’s still hurting. i don’t know how to help him. he sees a therapist once a week, but is not on any Rx. we’ve talked about that as well, and he feels like his “brain chemistry isn’t the problem, it’s just my life thats fucked up” and referred to himself as a cancer, something that needs to be cut out to save myself because he feels as though he’s ruining my life. i’ve assured him that is not at all how i feel, that he’s brought so much light into my life since we met. it breaks my heart every time i hear him say things like that or that i deserve something different than him. i see my whole life with this person. if he killed himself i don’t think i would be able to survive it.

,SuicideWatch,"Throwaway account because people I know irl are on Reddit, yada yada, I'm sure it's common practice in subs such as this. Especially because this post is gonna be an especially dark one.

The love of my life left me 4 months ago. I still love him as if it never happened. We've talked here and there but nothing ever became of it. Our last interaction ended horribly and as of now, it's been a little over 1 month of zero contact.

I. Can't. Fucking. Take. It. Anymore.

I NEED HIM BACK. It has never been impossible for me to get over someone. This person is my soulmate.

So that's fucking it. I'm gonna try one more time this week and if nothing happens in my favor, I'm gone. I refuse to spend one more month, year, the rest of my life without him.

Dear God, I hope you're seeing this because if he doesn't come home to me, I'm coming home to you.

I don't owe ya'll an explanation, but I wanna make it clear before I get accused of shit: I am NOT an obsessed yandere psycho although I realize my little rant makes it look that way. I'm just saying it how it is. I love him and I firmly believe we have been / will be together forever as soulmates. I just don't have the patience to wait around 60 years, you know? So imma head out and he can meet me when it's his natural time.

I have a very good life. My family is nice. I'm about to graduate college. I have 2 part time jobs and very much enjoy both of them. I'm quite well-off and can financially support both my needs and desires. I have a healthy-sized social circle of besties, colleagues, and family members. I love and appreciate everything/everyone I have. 

All of that is meaningless without him. And I'm tired of pretending it's not.

I don’t want to live anymore, I haven’t for a really long time now. I only want to be remembered through pictures, videos, memories. I want to be referred to as “was”.  I mean, I doubt anyone would really care to begin with. Being remembered so emotionally only sounds incredibly outlandish. I’ve been told it would hurt those I love when I do end this life. And it’s weird because I love them, but I don’t feel loved. It’s not that im scared to hurt those who love me but it’s to hurt those that I myself love. It’s the only thing that’s holding me back. I don’t know. It hurt so much now my bleedings numb. I know what’s happening. I just want to end everything.
I hate this feeling. This yearn to feel important to someone besides myself, to which I’m not even. It’s so pathetic isn’t it. But I know that know relationship of any kind can fill this hole in me, so I don’t even bother. The crazy part is, being incredibly lonely isn’t even the main source of my pain, only a major contributor. It’s everything around me. But I can’t stop thinking about my death. I just can’t stop imagining the people I know looking at a picture of me as the only thing left behind. Walking into the room that used to be mine. Nobody cares until I’m dead. But it’s not about them I suppose. It’s so confusing.&lt;/p&gt;

so if you’re a random person scrolling through this sub you probably haven’t read my last post which is fine. i’ll give a tldr. tldr; an online friend’s birthday was today so i haven’t killed myself despite having planned for it today, but due to our time difference, their birthday is now over. so… i’ll probably be doing it in a few hours or tomorrow morning if i can’t sneak the pills tonight.

i was already feeling really fucking terrible, but then my mom comes home and gives me a letter. tldr once again; the hospital wants to deem the last time i visited the er as an “accident” despite me clearly telling them it was an attempt so that my insurance doesn’t have to pay and i do.

first of all, it was not a fucking “accident”. a hanging suicide attempt was not an accident and they should know as much. second of all, i’m only 19 years old, i can’t be in debt, for *fuck’s* sake, and yet look at me. my mom said she’d try to get them to reconsider but it’s not a guarantee and if they don’t that i have to pay. i get it, i’m an adult, but she knows that my mental health is horrible right now and that i don’t have a job yet she’s still making me do that. is she within her legal right? maybe, but she’s still being an asshole. she’s screwing me over when she knows i have no way to fight back this debt. i don’t even know how much it’d be because they never said it.

i’m just so fucking over my life. this is fucking *great.* this is just fucking *fantastic.* (obviously /s.)

afterwards my mom had the audacity to tell me “not to keep doing this to myself” referring to my suicide attempts and she was…. mad. like, legit *mad*. not even concerned. just mad. i assume it was because of the money and how this could happen again. 

that was the last straw in my mind. i have a plethora of reasons i’m gonna end my life but this? this is just the fucking cherry on top. it was right then that i solidified my plan. she does realize telling me not to do it in such an upset tone just makes me want to do it more, right? especially when i know she’s more upset about the money aspect.

,SuicideWatch,"(19M) At some point a few years ago I found this video I really liked of a girl undressing on a porn subreddit. I thought the video was really attractive so I bookmarked it, and I watched it a lot of times. I never opened up the comments on it until a while after having originally found it, but eventually I did, and one of the replies was something along the lines of ""this girl is 15"". I read that comment and decided to keep watching and returning to that video anyway, up until like 2 or 3 months ago (when I decided to stop watching porn entirely for unrelated reasons and deleted everything I had). Before I read that comment I never even suspected that girl to have been underage, but every time after seeing it the idea that she could be lingered in my head as I chose to masturbate to the video anyway. I didn't want her to be 15, and if the comment was something like ""this girl is 15 and I know it for certain because \_\_\_\_"", I imagine, I HOPE I would have chose to remove it from my bookmarks, report it, and never look at it again, but instead I decided to be stupid and ignorant and tell myself ""there's no way to know if that person's right"" so I could continue to masturbate to that video as much as I wanted without feeling any guilt. I might have even liked the idea that it was something that could have been illegal, maybe it made it more exciting for me. I feel so fucking sick. 

I can't find the exact post of the video with the comment about her being 15, but I can find the same video posted in a ton of other subreddits, including being near one of the top posts in one. No one else seems to think she's 15, and it's been sitting in those other subreddits undeleted for 3 years, but the original gif which was hosted on gfycat was removed. I have no clue if that girl is 15 or not and I probably never will, but it doesn't even matter because I chose to masturbate to her with the idea of her possibly having been well underage in my mind every time I watched it.  

I feel like my life is over. There is no way I can forgive myself for this, and even if I could I don't think it's something the vast majority of people could forgive me for regardless.

I’m 6ft tall long legs short torso slim black hair receding hairline so yea I’m fucked

Never even touched a girl or spoke a word to or by one since 2012 and that was coworkers who treated me like shit compared to other dudes

I never leave the house now except going the store nearby at night with my hood up and snood covering my face partly and they’re fine with it.

2012-2015: world in a bar (Wetherspoons) it was great at first but then it went horrible. Women managers treating me like shit and bad mouthing me to the boss for nothing when the good looking guys could do no wrong and they’re all up their asses. Women customers 75% of the time were snobby and rude to me but when an attractive guy serves them they’re a different person. 

***One girl in there even said to me ‘we had a vote who we girls in here would stay away from and we picked you’ and then giggled (summed my time in there up)***

Guys were mostly good but I’d get the few ‘he’s an ugly bastard him’ comments when I walked away after serving them.

**Even before I had that job I had a job advisor who treated me poorly and made 0 effort  but put all the effort on to the prison hunky chads who sometimes were abusive**

I left and only did stadium jobs (decent money from it) 2-3 times a week and that was great at first then I noticed things like when I try to help a woman/girl they act all ‘😒’ and roll their eyes at me 

or avoid me and ask someone else further away for help was a regular occurrence 

Had instances where a girl would be with her dad for example and he’s say something to her about me then she’d look over at me and grimace with a disgusted look on her face and he’d be laughing at her playfully 

I’d go out thinking I’d look fine and we’ll and youthful even at 28 but I’d come back sitting still stiff for hours after some shifts at home :/

**▪️even on here I asked about my hairline once on malehairadvice and one comment said ‘very very ugly male’ while another replied to him ‘lol yea he’s clearly balding and hideous as fuck by the way’**

The pandemic came and I seen it a reason to not go out anymore 

I drink a 20cl bottle of scotch every night and smoke weed too (separately) as Iv nothing to look forward to.

I researched all the ways to do it without alerting my family that is how I took my life.
I took over 50 paracetamol within 24 hrs and I waited for the end.

The end never came.

I thought I was a failure even at taking my own life… but now even though my life is still falling apart, I found a light. I found someone who saw me for me and didn’t look away. Who saw me and still reached out their hand and told me that they needed to have someone like me in their world and so I am here, I stayed. 
I stayed and I went to a psychologist and I broke down and I showed my darkness and they didn’t turn away.

I’m not saying I still want to be here. Some days it’s hard. Today is hard. But I can see a light through my darkness

So I have told myself I will give it time. What is time if I am going to die anyway, what is a few more days if I get to see a smile on my children’s faces before I vanish.

I keep getting targeted a lot in school and I think all the people there, even the ones who don't care about me hold a disliking to me and would be much happier if I weren't having to be looked at. 

It's been like that my entirety of time in school because of how I am. I am different and bad to the ideals others have been taught but I don't think it means I shouldn't deserve to live like everyone else does.

I feel like the only reason they ever did was because they are nice people and hold that as their personality. I don't really have a personality and I just feel annoying. 

I always relied on them way too much and held them at the center of my world because I have a lot of issues attatching to people who will treat me with decency and show me attention. I tried to cling to them to get through everyday of being bullied and living an existence like this but it seems like I ended up only burdening them too. 

I feel sad when they don't prioritize me at all even though I know I don't deserve it and people should chose the best people for them so they can be made happy. I always have to apologize for one thing or another because I just feel like I'm not good enough at all and there's so many regular things I can't do.

I tried to cling to them to get through everyday of being bullied and living an existence like this but it seems like I ended up only burdening them too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel sad when they don&amp;#39;t prioritize me at all even though I know I don&amp;#39;t deserve it and people should chose the best people for them so they can be made happy. I always have to apologize for one thing or another because I just feel like I&amp;#39;m not good enough at all and there&amp;#39;s so many regular things I can&amp;#39;t do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I am like that even to the people I love, even to my family, even to the people at school who don&amp;#39;t even know me I don&amp;#39;t feel deserving of trying to live. 
Does everyone have a right to? I really wish my existence could help anyone instead of only making things worse for others and being an eyesore. 
Does the world have a system like this? Do I have a right to be here at all?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gotta raise my med dose, though; I’ve been playing it safe so I don’t get sent to a psych ward so I downplay my depression and deny suicidal tendencies (even though those are true…) point is that I’ve been through 4 different meds now and this is the only one that has actually done something, I think. Just needs to do a little more, or maybe it’s working intended. I’ll talk to him about it today if I get around to it.&lt;/p&gt;

She cheated on me twice and left me for the other man. I lost my job, my father passed in the midsts, and I’m restarting from a paycheck to paycheck job with a promotion into the sales team on the horizon.

I have been forcing myself to go out with friends as much as I can, I have forced myself to meet people. I had a FWB for a couple weeks before they moved states. I’ve been talking to two women online, both of which are poly and married, and they love me but I can only feel the tiniest affection toward them because of my mental health. They are both amazing, kind, caring people, far more empathy than my ex and far more open with communication. These things helped on the very short term only. It’s like im craving something to give me reprieve from the painful experience of existing.

This last week has been near unbearable. I’ve had to take long lunches at my new job to calm down, I’ve been in tears every single morning and it used to last an hour and now I’m fighting it off until late afternoon.

,SuicideWatch,I don’t usually use Reddit but I am not sure where else to put this. It’s been confirmed my friends dislike me due to my drinking and all round shitty behaviour. I deserve this treatment from them but I’ve lost the people I truly loved and have hurt countless others.

I felt so bad and was so worried what she might do, I told her I would continue to date her. About a week ago, I decided that I am going to break up with her for good. I planned a trip out of the state so she would be unable to come to my house and beg. Before breaking up with her, I called her parents and told them what I was going to do and also that she is suicidal. I break up with her, she sobs uncontrollably, but I stand my ground and board the plane. Two days after I leave, she goes out with some friends, including a guy. Some of the friends leave, just leaving her and the guy. He R\*\*\*\*\* her in his car that night. She called me yesterday and finally had the courage to tell me what happened. She hasn't told anyone besides me, because I am the only one she trusts. I feel so devastated for her and can't even imagine how this feels for her on top of the breakup.

I felt so bad and was so worried what she might do, I told her I would continue to date her. About a week ago, I decided that I am going to break up with her for good. I planned a trip out of the state so she would be unable to come to my house and beg. Before breaking up with her, I called her parents and told them what I was going to do and also that she is suicidal. I break up with her, she sobs uncontrollably, but I stand my ground and board the plane. Two days after I leave, she goes out with some friends, including a guy. Some of the friends leave, just leaving her and the guy. He R***** her in his car that night. She called me yesterday and finally had the courage to tell me what happened. She hasn&amp;#39;t told anyone besides me, because I am the only one she trusts. I feel so devastated for her and can&amp;#39;t even imagine how this feels for her on top of the breakup. I have a terrible feeling that If I stop talking to her (She will never stop calling/texting on her own, so my only option is to block her,) She will actually commit suicide. Right now, she is begging to keep talking on the phone for &amp;quot;one more week.&amp;quot; I know that I should stop talking to her, but I don&amp;#39;t want the guilt if she does unalive herself. Please help me, I really appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;

Let's start, 2018 I was 13, I got in a relationship with a girl I had a crush on for years, it was all going well until about march of 2019 when we started to drift apart because my social anxiety was getting so bad I could barely leave my bedroom, let alone talk to people in school but she started to say things like ""if you loved me you'd come over and talk to my friends"" I tried to talk to her about how I felt physically sick thinking about leaving my room and she called me pathetic. She broke up with me around May 2019. I was 14 and I started drinking very heavily as a coping mechanism, I managed to quit it but then I started to self harm (I won't go into details but I have scars that make me scared to wear t-shirts with too short sleaves). Fast forward 5 months I had 1 attempt at suicide and many trips to the train station and long thoughts about jumping. But in comes my now ex, I'm gonna call her p. P is the girl of my dreams she is pretty cleaver funny and is into all the same things as me, we started talking in October and she helped me stop self harming, we talked and started dating in late December 2019. I was so happy, I found my soul mate. We had 3 wonderful years together with long talks about marriage and starting a family, which brings us to yesterday. I had been in holiday with my family and she was on a camp with cadets. We both got home yesterday and I was so excited to see her. She said we should go for a drive (she has a licence I don't) and I was really excited. I got in her car with her easter egg and presents I bought her from Disney but she looked away. She drove us to somewhere quiet and told me that she had been thinking about us having a break for a few weeks to months but was too scared to tell me but that night she was kissed by someone on her camp and didn't stop because she liked it. I'm currently angry sad confused and drunk as I write this.

Now onto my mum, she has a rare cancer which should be easily treated but because of the shear incompetence of the NHS it spread significantly before we went private and its now at the point of no return. I think is one is self explanatory.

Now onto me, I'm pretty sure I have autism and adhd and I'm looking into getting tested for them, I'm also trying to get a diagnosis of depression and anxiety but I really don't know how long these are going to take.

,SuicideWatch,"Hello Reddit

I figured I'd give this a try and see if anybody has any advice that would help steer me away. I've had suicidal thoughts since 14 or 15 I guess; typical sad story grew up in a difficult household through a divorce and ultimately deceased father. Removed myself from the rest of the family once I could because they are awful people and made me miserable, calling me slurs, etc. 

I since moved out and then moved away. Didn't really have any friends when I left, and since moving here like 7 months ago I haven't made a single friend. Given, I've only tried dating/friend apps and can't get myself to go anywhere in person to try and make friends alone. I leave my apartment like once a week on average, sometimes sooner sometimes later. I recently ended up in the ER with heart issues and had to quit taking my Adderall XR hat I started mid December. Well, i initially dropped down to 5mg from 25mg, and that was still giving me issues so I had to quit completely as it appears I developed reynauds. 

I dont have money. I work an ok customer service job (it's work from home, and they're nice) and am writing this on my lunch break because it's been all I can think about today. I have severe psoriasis that covers my entire body, apparently reynauds, end up having an allergy or now a heart issue from all the psychiatric medications I've tried. Antidepressants, adderall, several different kinds like ssri snri and some others. Adderall was helping, but rip. Prone to several other issues due to psoriasis, never seen a dentist so that's a whole shitstorm I haven't even opened up yet. It feels like so much is permanently wrong with me and I can't afford any treatment or doctors for any of it anymore. 

I just dont know what else to do anymore. My cat has always been what kept me from going because she has only ever liked me and is scared of my absence, but it's getting so bad I want to do it anyways despite loving her to death. I'm lonely. I spend all of my freetime distracting myself by playing a video game.  I want to ""live on and see what life could be"" but I've been trying that for 8 years and it's never been something that great. I've been missing work and feel like I may have to clock out early today which would put me at negative attendance points and cause further issues with that. I'm concerned that there's nothing anyone can say to make me feel better, want to continue trying, or whatever else but I wanted to try because there's so many different perspectives available and maybe someone has one that'll get through to me. I'd love to see life maybe be something but it hasn't been and I just don't know how many more days I can take of this torment just for a ""maybe"" because I could be damaged beyond repair. I've never been able to study and get a better paying job like I want to, already dropped out of college twice. I've explored options for online certifications but I just have absolutely 0 motivation to try any of it and I don't know how to get motivated. I see a lot of nice tiktoks / slideshows that sometimes inspire me but I never end up doing anything. I can't look at myself in the mirror or brush my teeth consistently. 

If anybody has the time to read my post and procure a response that would be really kind. I don't expect anybody to inject me with feel happy and have hope but any response, perspective, or advice is greatly appreciated. I threw this post together quickly but tried to cover everything that ailes me, apologies for some run-on sentences.

&lt;p&gt;I since moved out and then moved away. Didn&amp;#39;t really have any friends when I left, and since moving here like 7 months ago I haven&amp;#39;t made a single friend. Given, I&amp;#39;ve only tried dating/friend apps and can&amp;#39;t get myself to go anywhere in person to try and make friends alone. I leave my apartment like once a week on average, sometimes sooner sometimes later. I recently ended up in the ER with heart issues and had to quit taking my Adderall XR hat I started mid December. Well, i initially dropped down to 5mg from 25mg, and that was still giving me issues so I had to quit completely as it appears I developed reynauds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dont have money. I work an ok customer service job (it&amp;#39;s work from home, and they&amp;#39;re nice) and am writing this on my lunch break because it&amp;#39;s been all I can think about today. I have severe psoriasis that covers my entire body, apparently reynauds, end up having an allergy or now a heart issue from all the psychiatric medications I&amp;#39;ve tried. Antidepressants, adderall, several different kinds like ssri snri and some others. Adderall was helping, but rip. Prone to several other issues due to psoriasis, never seen a dentist so that&amp;#39;s a whole shitstorm I haven&amp;#39;t even opened up yet. It feels like so much is permanently wrong with me and I can&amp;#39;t afford any treatment or doctors for any of it anymore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just dont know what else to do anymore. My cat has always been what kept me from going because she has only ever liked me and is scared of my absence, but it&amp;#39;s getting so bad I want to do it anyways despite loving her to death. I&amp;#39;m lonely. I spend all of my freetime distracting myself by playing a video game.  I want to &amp;quot;live on and see what life could be&amp;quot; but I&amp;#39;ve been trying that for 8 years and it&amp;#39;s never been something that great. I&amp;#39;ve been missing work and feel like I may have to clock out early today which would put me at negative attendance points and cause further issues with that. I&amp;#39;m concerned that there&amp;#39;s nothing anyone can say to make me feel better, want to continue trying, or whatever else but I wanted to try because there&amp;#39;s so many different perspectives available and maybe someone has one that&amp;#39;ll get through to me. I&amp;#39;d love to see life maybe be something but it hasn&amp;#39;t been and I just don&amp;#39;t know how many more days I can take of this torment just for a &amp;quot;maybe&amp;quot; because I could be damaged beyond repair. I&amp;#39;ve never been able to study and get a better paying job like I want to, already dropped out of college twice. I&amp;#39;ve explored options for online certifications but I just have absolutely 0 motivation to try any of it and I don&amp;#39;t know how to get motivated. I see a lot of nice tiktoks / slideshows that sometimes inspire me but I never end up doing anything. I can&amp;#39;t look at myself in the mirror or brush my teeth consistently. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anybody has the time to read my post and procure a response that would be really kind. I don&amp;#39;t expect anybody to inject me with feel happy and have hope but any response, perspective, or advice is greatly appreciated. I threw this post together quickly but tried to cover everything that ailes me, apologies for some run-on sentences. Thank you for your time!&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"Y'know, it'd be so nice and easy if we had a little switch in our brains or something, and just by thinking about a certain thing we could just die. It would just shut down the whole body and stuff. it'd make this shit Alot easier, huh?

People always asks what more they could've done to save them, but then turns around and puts people in institutions to be 'fixed' for these feelings. If it's so normal to feel this low, then why can no one talk about it?

I've come to the realization that even if i got professional help, that i wouldn't be cured. That i wouldn't really be able to talk about what I'm feeling. or more accurately, the lack of.  I've also come to the realization that my life has no purpose, nothing that makes it different than any others. Nothing that warrants me to live.

I have no feelings when i talk to people, let it be strangers, friends, family (for the most part.) , Others. Watching things i Don't feel anything either, everything is just boring.

 My family gets so angry, that I'm being selfish by not talking to them, or not smiling when i should, or crying when i should, not letting them know how i feel and the list goes on. Sometimes they get so angry at me, or just things around, that they smash things on the floor or throw things. Only then i can really pinpoint a feeling, which is usually fear or sadness. Anything loud or yelling triggers this though.

Sometimes when I'm in my room I'll think of something, or ill see something that reminds me of memories and start feeling sad, and scared and it won't go away for hours, sometimes days. I could lie to myself and say I dont know the problem, which is only a half truth.

 Memories i won't let go of, i still hold a grudge even though it's been years. I'm still frightened by them. I still feel worthless, and i only wish i could prove to someone what they've done.  I know that something is wrong with me as a person, and I'm horrible for putting my family through this . I know most of it was years ago but i can't get rid of it. These things play through my mind on loop and i can't get a hold of my self, i dont even know who i am as a person anymore. 

Being locked in a tight closet for hours, given black eyes for lying as a toddler,  being locked outside in a snowstorm, making me walk around the block in the pitch dark for failing that spelling test, throwing away all my toys as a child, not even letting me keep anything, because we were moving , and so many other things i Don't want to even name here cause so hard to write let alone think about. 

I feel so dirty, especially when i think of the unhygienic gross ones. But these all happened years ago, it should be fine now, my life should be a dream. But it's not, i can't stop remembering these things, i can't get past them. For awhile they kept telling me that they never happened,.that i was crazy. Then they say 'well it happened years ago, you should forgive us by now!'. 

Maybe they'll forgive me years from now. I feel bad that I'm going to leave them with my dead body in their home soon. I just want to be a good son, and stop making such a fuss.

,SuicideWatch,"This is lengthy and I'm sorry I can't condense my thoughts here.

I was born with a cerebral palsy, and for the better part of my childhood it affected my physical development; though I came around through some years of rehabilitation training, my self esteem was definitely targeted in being bullied by other children; including such events as being choked out by several kids. At home I was experiencing abuse, neglect, and often abandonment at the hands of my mom and her boyfriend; my parents divorced when I was 5 and she shipped us(my older sister and I) off to the fucking hood with her and found a cocaine addict she thought she could fix(her words). When my younger sisters were born and I was a little older they were often dropped on me to take care of and I effectively raised them in my parent's stead while they worked for people that rarely paid them if they weren't getting trashed outright. Cue eviction after eviction. My unhappiness with everything then definitely made me a bit of a sensitive kid back then, so naturally that bullying followed me until I dropped out at 16. The violence was getting intense at home and I was practically fighting the dumb boyfriend off every fucking day. I offhandedly mentioned I was feeling suicidal to my mom once, and she decided to weaponize it for me that day on with emotional blackmail. After a particular violent fight at 18 with the boyfriend where he threw my own fucking mom at me, and seeing how she still defended him, I realized this was my fucking life if I stayed there. I realized that this was my sister's lives if I didn't do something. So I moved to be near my bio dad and get a fresh start, and surprised the fuck out of myself. I worked harder than I ever did worrying about myself instead of being forced to take care of others for the first time ever and even made some friends, got my diploma, and even some college creds during the end of my senior year. My dissociation was fading and I felt genuinely like a person for the first time. Then my fucking dad gets diagnosed with cancer, and then all the drama of that end of the family comes out; dad cursed his family out on his death bed for their mistreatment of him.. There was considerable favoritism in that family but it really all clicked for me then; I went no-contact with them afterward when they told me they're thankful I can be around to replace him. Thats your son, your brother, your uncle, what the absolute fuck? I tried reconnecting with mom who was homeless at the time because people can change right and its been years? I found out all the money I sent was being used to fuel her boyfriend and her's heroin addiction and not food which I lost around 15k on doing. Thank god friends of the family took and supported the sisters during this time at the very least, and they're way better off today all on their own.

I moved in with a friend down the line and spent a few years understanding myself, looking into mental health, self help, everything while I got into the best shape of my life and even tried dating at the end of it; probably to one of the most narcistic, neurotic, and shitty person who sapped the absolute momentum I was building up. Last year I winded up getting diagnosed with cancer myself and finished treatment in december. I tried to keep my spirit upbeat and continue college which I'm doing high honors for something good going on, but I'm so fucking tired. Its just a series of losses and very few wins. I keep trying to challenge my perspective to see what I'm doing wrong, I'm told I'm a great communicator, I'm even told I'm hard-working but it never seems to fucking amount to anything significant and I'm still disappointed I can't have a normal fucking life. I'm pissed that I have no normal family dynamic, people to depend on, and that I had no fucking support for the cancer from ""friends"" all the same who never bothered to ask me about it or offer to just be around. I'm tired of the most recent series of relationships(friendships and dating) I'm putting myself out there to make, and despite things going well for months on end, with deep conversations and trying to be a healthy support for them, they withdraw or ghost me in the end. And in doing the extra legwork to see if I'm doing something wrong in finding a happenstance to talk to them, its apparently not my fault and I'm such a great friend/support/ect they just don't want the responsibility with the relationship at the time. So why'd you fucking make the commitment? Is this really my fucking punishment of trying to be the ""right"" person? To be positive, supportive, and not burden you with my own bullshit? To try and assume the best of someone? I just get the social rug pulled under me? I'm never going to amount to shit and I feel like serve no fucking personal meaning to anyone in the end.

And in doing the extra legwork to see if I&amp;#39;m doing something wrong in finding a happenstance to talk to them, its apparently not my fault and I&amp;#39;m such a great friend/support/ect they just don&amp;#39;t want the responsibility with the relationship at the time. So why&amp;#39;d you fucking make the commitment? Is this really my fucking punishment of trying to be the &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; person? To be positive, supportive, and not burden you with my own bullshit? To try and assume the best of someone? I just get the social rug pulled under me? I&amp;#39;m never going to amount to shit and I feel like serve no fucking personal meaning to anyone in the end. I haven&amp;#39;t had a fucking holiday with anyone in over 6 years, and this Easter is just another weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do I even fucking try, man? I don&amp;#39;t even know why I&amp;#39;m living anymore. I just want to be asleep and never wake up.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"Hey don't know if this can be posted here and not sure why I am even putting it up but I guess I wanted to see if people thought I was blaming my dad in this note or if I wasn't owning up to my failures. I want to try and explain everything I am currently feeling to him when I eventually send it to him. I also understand that I may get comments saying suicide isn't an option and you have so much to live for etc. I appreciate the words of encouragement but would like any questions or comments be in regards to the letter and not suicide.

I don't deserve any sort of response and I don't know why I am bothering you but I don't have anyone else really besides some friends who I would fear judging me for being weak and pathetic.

This past week I found out that I am a very unhealthy person. Wednesday 04/05/23 was the start of my down spiral and plans were made and then weighed for practicality. Oddly enough I ended up deciding on VSED which never would have been possible anyways since as time past I would be incapable of preventing an emt from providing iv fluids. But out of my available options I figured it was the potentially least scarring for anya to see. Although I know no matter what it would increase her risk I was hopeful that she would be too young to remember me. I didnt drink or eat anything for roughly 50 hours.

On Friday 04/07/23 I decided to see if someone could potentially change my mind so I sent a message to my psychiatrist and also called 988. In all honesty 988 did nothing to help they seem to enjoy saying the same thing over and over. ""I can understand you are in a lot of pain."" Blah blah blah.

Still under the assumption both Rachel and Anya would have an easier time without me I was dead set on following through. Knowing that I would eventually collapse from dehydration I texted Rachel explaining that we were over and that I was leaving. I planned to withdraw $400 in cash from a random atm and find a motel or hotel to stay in for a few nights.

I proceeded to get dressed(been working from home) and prepared to leave when Rachel got home. We ended up talking and we figured out a way to potentially save our marriage. I dont think its my place to discuss what we have decided on. I am willing to do and try anything if it will make her happy. But i am not sure if it will work and if it doesn't I have every intention of going through with the VSED which is a ""super healthy"" reaction to divorce but I have no desire of fighting for custody for my daughter and as I said earlier she is young enough to potentially forget me. I also have no idea who or what I am without her which is also ""super healthy.""

My psychiatrist is currently looking for a therapist for me and it will most likely take a few months or so for me to figure out if I am OK or not with this new dynamic amd decide on what to do.

The psychiatrist I am seeing is part of a program to perform ect so that could also happen soon. That might help. I have been on 4 or 5 different antidepressants in the past 7 or 8 months trying to find something that is effective. Granted I know I haven't been doing it right since I should also include talk therapy with it but I've always found it annoying to talk to somebody about the feelings I have successfully repressed in an attempt to feel nothing.

Oddly enough texting my feelings is a bit easier not sure why, probably due to my ADHD that let's me just ramble on. 

It is a bit odd the clarity and freedom I feel knowing that I might die in a few months. I don't think I would have been able to text you under any other circumstance besides I guess a farewell note. 

I don't know why our relationship is the way it is. Maybe I was always searching for some type of motherly love due to the failed relationships I had with my foster mother and biological mother. And because of that I attempted to enter into any type of relationship with a woman to the detriment of myself and those around me. Going so far as to push away eveyone. Or I could just be an asshole who is stubborn and refuses to admit he is wrong. Maybe a little bit of both.

I don't know if you regret adopting me, but I am very appreciative of the chance you took on me even if in the end it resulted in you being hurt. I will say that I was very hurt when you refused to go to Anyas birthday party. I know but don't think I understand the issues you had with Gail. But at the time Rachel and I were flat broke and even having a birthday party for my daughter was stretching our finances dangerously thin, think we failed to pay the electric that month. I would have preferred to have it at your house but it was under construction and since it was going to  rain we couldn't have it outside like we had planned. I tried texting you a few times after you said you wouldn't be able to make it, but got no response so I assumed you cut me out. Which I guess was latter reinforced when Rachel texted you about Anya and I getting into an accident that totaled the car and gave me a concussion but we didn't get any response.

I am not trying to place any blame or anything as in the end none of it really matters. What's done is done and sometimes there is nothing we can do to change the results. I am a pretty selfish and manipulative person I have a very hard time telling the truth even to myself and because of that I always look to get as much as I can out of anyone and any situation. I like to think I have changed in the past year or so by trying to be more open and honest about my shortcomings and fears. I'm not sure why I was or possibly still am like that. I don't know if it's just who I am, or if I learned it in foster care. I am not blaming my failures on foster care because if I truly wanted to I could have learned to stop it and change myself. You gave me many opportunities in order for me to do that and maybe it took until I was a father for it to really sink in that I needed to change.

I know they say that suicide is a forever solution to a temporary problem and it isn't really a choice but running away. It's hard to see it that way. Even going beyond the survivors guilt I still feel and has gotten worse since Anya is around the same age as JJ was. The depression alone has not been a temporary problem seeing as I feel like I've had depression since I was 4. Even on medication and talk therapy I don't think I ever felt truly free of my depression. Therefore maybe suicide is a permanent solution to a permanent problem.

But I digress I wanted to write this and just say I am sorry that despite every opportunity and chance you gave I just slapped your hand away. You didn't deserve that and I apologize for it.

,SuicideWatch,"Hey don't know if this can be posted here and not sure why I am even putting it up but I guess I wanted to see if people thought I was blaming my dad in this note or if I wasn't owning up to my failures. I want to try and explain everything I am currently feeling to him when I eventually send it to him. I also understand that I may get comments saying suicide isn't an option and you have so much to live for etc. I appreciate the words of encouragement but would like any questions or comments be in regards to the letter and not suicide.

I don't deserve any sort of response and I don't know why I am bothering you but I don't have anyone else really besides some friends who I would fear judging me for being weak and pathetic.

This past week I found out that I am a very unhealthy person. Wednesday 04/05/23 was the start of my down spiral and plans were made and then weighed for practicality. Oddly enough I ended up deciding on VSED which never would have been possible anyways since as time past I would be incapable of preventing an emt from providing iv fluids. But out of my available options I figured it was the potentially least scarring for anya to see. Although I know no matter what it would increase her risk I was hopeful that she would be too young to remember me. I didnt drink or eat anything for roughly 50 hours.

On Friday 04/07/23 I decided to see if someone could potentially change my mind so I sent a message to my psychiatrist and also called 988. In all honesty 988 did nothing to help they seem to enjoy saying the same thing over and over. ""I can understand you are in a lot of pain."" Blah blah blah.

Still under the assumption both Rachel and Anya would have an easier time without me I was dead set on following through. Knowing that I would eventually collapse from dehydration I texted Rachel explaining that we were over and that I was leaving. I planned to withdraw $400 in cash from a random atm and find a motel or hotel to stay in for a few nights.

I proceeded to get dressed(been working from home) and prepared to leave when Rachel got home. We ended up talking and we figured out a way to potentially save our marriage. I dont think its my place to discuss what we have decided on. I am willing to do and try anything if it will make her happy. But i am not sure if it will work and if it doesn't I have every intention of going through with the VSED which is a ""super healthy"" reaction to divorce but I have no desire of fighting for custody for my daughter and as I said earlier she is young enough to potentially forget me. I also have no idea who or what I am without her which is also ""super healthy.""

My psychiatrist is currently looking for a therapist for me and it will most likely take a few months or so for me to figure out if I am OK or not with this new dynamic amd decide on what to do.

The psychiatrist I am seeing is part of a program to perform ect so that could also happen soon. That might help. I have been on 4 or 5 different antidepressants in the past 7 or 8 months trying to find something that is effective. Granted I know I haven't been doing it right since I should also include talk therapy with it but I've always found it annoying to talk to somebody about the feelings I have successfully repressed in an attempt to feel nothing.

Oddly enough texting my feelings is a bit easier not sure why, probably due to my ADHD that let's me just ramble on. 

It is a bit odd the clarity and freedom I feel knowing that I might die in a few months. I don't think I would have been able to text you under any other circumstance besides I guess a farewell note. 

I don't know why our relationship is the way it is. Maybe I was always searching for some type of motherly love due to the failed relationships I had with my foster mother and biological mother. And because of that I attempted to enter into any type of relationship with a woman to the detriment of myself and those around me. Going so far as to push away eveyone. Or I could just be an asshole who is stubborn and refuses to admit he is wrong. Maybe a little bit of both.

I don't know if you regret adopting me, but I am very appreciative of the chance you took on me even if in the end it resulted in you being hurt. I will say that I was very hurt when you refused to go to Anyas birthday party. I know but don't think I understand the issues you had with Gail. But at the time Rachel and I were flat broke and even having a birthday party for my daughter was stretching our finances dangerously thin, think we failed to pay the electric that month. I would have preferred to have it at your house but it was under construction and since it was going to  rain we couldn't have it outside like we had planned. I tried texting you a few times after you said you wouldn't be able to make it, but got no response so I assumed you cut me out. Which I guess was latter reinforced when Rachel texted you about Anya and I getting into an accident that totaled the car and gave me a concussion but we didn't get any response.

I am not trying to place any blame or anything as in the end none of it really matters. What's done is done and sometimes there is nothing we can do to change the results. I am a pretty selfish and manipulative person I have a very hard time telling the truth even to myself and because of that I always look to get as much as I can out of anyone and any situation. I like to think I have changed in the past year or so by trying to be more open and honest about my shortcomings and fears. I'm not sure why I was or possibly still am like that. I don't know if it's just who I am, or if I learned it in foster care. I am not blaming my failures on foster care because if I truly wanted to I could have learned to stop it and change myself. You gave me many opportunities in order for me to do that and maybe it took until I was a father for it to really sink in that I needed to change.

I know they say that suicide is a forever solution to a temporary problem and it isn't really a choice but running away. It's hard to see it that way. Even going beyond the survivors guilt I still feel and has gotten worse since Anya is around the same age as JJ was. The depression alone has not been a temporary problem seeing as I feel like I've had depression since I was 4. Even on medication and talk therapy I don't think I ever felt truly free of my depression. Therefore maybe suicide is a permanent solution to a permanent problem.

But I digress I wanted to write this and just say I am sorry that despite every opportunity and chance you gave I just slapped your hand away. You didn't deserve that and I apologize for it.

,SuicideWatch,"I have met a girl on Tinder in November and she was Swedish, she completely toyed with me and ended up just using me for attention until she got fed up, ghosted me and eventually blocked me. I am 22 years old and never had a genuine connection with a girl and with every shitty experience my pit of despair becomes a little deeper. Since I am currently writing my bachelor thesis and had to look for a place for my Masters I decided I might go to Sweden (don't fucking ask me why). I started learning Swedish and on a language learning app I met a Swedish girl (January). We started talking a lot, had multiple hour phone calls and if one were to read our texts one would have thought we were boyfriend and girlfriend. My bachelor thesis is going terribly and has taken a huge toll on my mental health. The prospect of meeting her is what kept me going. We talked a lot about meeting each other and I booked a flight to come meet her in June. (This was in March) a week later she freaked out and told me to  cancel. I told her I did (I did not, since I would have gotten no money back so cancelling or not taking the flight would be the same result). We agreed to just be friends, however after a few days she started to act affectionate with me again and when I was drunk I asked her what was going on and she said she wanted to be more than friends.

Last week I was rejected by the Swedish universities. It appeared as everything was completely fine between us. I told her last week that I did not actually cancel the flight and that if she wants to we could still meet,she said yes. 

Tonight she told me we need to talk about me coming over and essentially said she does not have a romantic interest in me and I only made her feel special and she did not want to lose that. I told ber how much this hurts as this is now the second time she did this to me and how I told her about all my trauma and why she did all of this despite knowing this. She just straight up blocked me.

I don't know what to do anymore. I have no master spot, my bachelor is going terribly and the one person who has been my anchor through out 2023 has cut me out like I meant nothing and every single time I think I met a person who could be my girlfriend it ends with a world of hurt.

Despite this I have been seriously thinking about killing my self. It’s been in the back of my mind for a while and even though some days I can beat those thoughts they are still there. I feel pretty ungrateful but it’s been gradually getting worse and i’m at a point now where i’m close. Damn close. Now I also have a method i’m satisfied with. Finally got some benzos and my plan is to mix them with alcohol and sleep forever. I don’t even know what the matter is. There were times last summer when I was getting shitfaced drunk and cutting myself in my room, alone. No one knows I’m going through this. If I actually committed, I know for certain almost everyone would be shocked and wouldn’t understand why I did it. I don’t even know myself but I am so alone in this pain. I’ve tried everything from going to the gym for years to learning instruments and these are just distractions and in the end i’m left with myself and these thoughts. Nothing truly helps and I think i’m done. The more I think about it the more I am convinced.&lt;/p&gt;
