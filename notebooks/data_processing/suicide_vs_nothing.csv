"New wiki on how to avoid accidentally encouraging suicide, and how to spot covert incitement","We've been seeing a worrying increase in pro-suicide content showing up here and, and also going unreported. This undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide.  

We've created a wiki that covers these issues.  We hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report.  It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an ""innocent"" message like ""if you're 100% committed, I'll just wish you peace"" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments. The full text of the wiki's current version is below, and it is maintained at [/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement). 

We deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to our OPs, and we particularly thank everyone who's already been reporting incitement in all forms.  

Please report any post or comment that encourages suicide (or that breaks any of the other guidelines in the sidebar) to the moderators, either by clicking the ""report"" button or by [sending us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) with a link. We deal with all guideline violations that are reported to us as soon as we can, but we can't read everything so community reports are essential. If you get a PM that breaks the guidelines, please report it both [to the reddit sitewide admins](http://www.reddit.com/report) and to us in modmail. 

Thanks to all the great citizens of the community who help flag problem content and behaviour for us.

###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. **It's both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someone's suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision.**

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.

Please remember that NO ACTIVISM of any kind is ever allowed here. No matter what day it is.,"Activism, i.e. advocating or fundraising for social change or raising awareness of social issues (and suicide is, inescapably, a social issue) is absolutely against the rules here at all times. 

Please understand that we're all for smart, strategic mental-health and suicide-prevention activism. It's essential to fight against stigma, misinformation, and discrimination, and to fight for research, treatment, accommodation, acceptance, and understanding. Most of us, one way or another, are mental-health activists IRL. 

But activism just doesn't work in a dedicated support space that serves a vulnerable population. We used to allow it but the evidence that it was undermining our primary purpose became overwhelming.  We do regret the need for this rule, but the need is inescapable. 

Our population is all too well aware of the issues and causes that need support and largely not in a position to take action, so besides the fact that activism is often salt in our community's wounds, it's a waste of the activists' time.

**tl;dr** Any fundraising, awareness raising, petitions, calls for participation, or any post that's about any cause or issue (rather than a request for personal support) is not allowed here.  Please report everything of the nature that you see.",SQLwitch,43,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pl9suy/please_remember_that_no_activism_of_any_kind_is/,activism e advocating fundraising social change raising awareness social issue suicide inescapably social issue absolutely rule time please understand smart strategic mental health suicide prevention activism essential fight stigma misinformation discrimination fight research treatment accommodation acceptance understanding u one way another mental health activist irl activism work dedicated support space serf vulnerable population used allow evidence wa undermining primary purpose became overwhelming regret need rule need inescapable population well aware issue cause need support largely position take action besides fact activism often salt community wound waste activist time tl dr fundraising awareness raising petition call participation post cause issue rather request personal support allowed please report everything nature see,please remember activism kind ever allowed matter day,sql witch

I'm 25 (M), weed addict, I dropped out of university when I was 23 and I literally see no future for myself. I haven't left my room in a long time and the only time I'm outdoors is to either buy weed or ciggs, I sleep most of the day with all windows closed, I hate seeing sunlight .

I don't shower much, I don't brush my teeth and the samllest task feels like climbing a mountain to me, I'm always so drained n overwhelmed and my social life just doesn't exist anymore .

The only time I feel slightly better is nighttime where I would smoke some weed in my dark room so I could finally eat and enjoy listening to music . I spent the last 3 years doing the same fucking shit everyday, I'm really sick of living and I hate relying on weed to do the minimum basic things , I am a prisoner of my depression and I can't break free.

I'm a man. I shouldn't feel this way,"I'm 17, GERD, IBS, a fucked up mind, home life and other various health issues have forced me out of education and continue to prevent me finding work.

We have no money, my mum says it's fine but the lack of food and the number of debt letters through the letterbox are starting to show. We have no machine for clothes and the laundrette is either closed or too expensive. 

My brother comes home, makes everything a mess, treats us like shit, plays loud music and keeps me up past 1 am, abuses me, eats what little we have left, moans and goes to his girlfriends. Today he's moved his speakers closer to my wall so if I couldn't hear his music. now I can. I get so sick at night and I down painkillers and pills to stop the nausea and pain. **and he expects** ***me*** **to work.** we are the same age, he has everything given to him and always puts work in at his girlfriends, he uses our house like a fucking dumping ground and we've got to pick up the pieces. I can't stop him or he will hit me or abuse me or break my things. or chase me into my room and take the handle so I can't  get out. 

I was prescribed anti-depressants (**way** too high a dose) when I told my doctor the pain made me want to kill myself. the first dose spooked me and you'll have to restrain me before I even consider touching them again. 

I have no job, no clean clothes, rarely enough food, chronic illnesses and an awful home-life.

I messaged childline and they sent a referral to social services. who called me on a private number. **I can't answer phone calls, he will hear them and then start picking at me for it.** I picked up the guitar and started playing, he said I'm shit, he's so much better. took it out of my hands and started showing off.

You should never choose violence, but I have no choice anymore. 

I'm trying so hard not to break everything in sight or get the scissors and go for my arms again. or throw myself off a bridge. In my emails to childline I made it clear (when I was calm) that the amount I was thinking of suicide or these unwanted violent thoughts had me worried for my own mental health. 

There is silver lining to the rainy cloud but too little too late. I can't be angry with my mum she's trying her best, but I wish I wasn't born. I can't live like this. I don't want to live. 

I tried counselling but could never find the number to rebook and was never contacted. My stomach issues have fucked up my heart (apparently) and I could have developed arrhythmia from it if I wasn't born from it. I wish I'd have a heart attack or a stroke (which I might end up doing from all this stress) just so someone **finally** listens to me. best case scenario it kills me and I never have to deal with this again. 

I'm a man. I shouldn't feel like this.

Suicidal thoughts since I was 13.,"Please recommend me some less painful ways a 15 year old can suicide. Since I turned 13 in July 2021. During September 2021, I started having suicidal thoughts because I was disappointed in myself. I don't have any self-confidence and never tried to improve myself. I don't want my parents to know about my true self. I like my mother but not my father as he is very strict and gets angry easily. I haven't told anyone about my suicidal thoughts, and now the pressure has gone up to the point that i can't sleep properly, and my head constantly aches, and my chest and throat feel heavy. I was given 2 warning letters in a month for keeping my phone with me during a mock 2 grade 11 exam, and during 1, I had cheated and was caught. I know it's my fault, but this further increased my will to suicide. I don't know what to do, I don't know whether I should tell my mother or not, I don't even know what I want to be when I grow up. I was smart till I started having suicidal thoughts and to cope with them i started reading manga and manhwa but that has started effecting my marks to the point that I am failing around 3  subjects now. I haven't done anything about it as I lack self confidence and think that a person like me will definitely not be able to do anything in life and that there's no point so I should just be on my device, not study and if I just cheat during an exam and not get caught I will be fine, but in my heart, I know it's wrong, but I haven't been able to change myself or muster up courage to change.

I'm tured,"I've been paralyzed since August 2022. The day before my 22nd birthday, I jumped off a building and survived a paraplegic. A week before that I took 72 prescription pills. Before that, I had a few other attempts starting at 8y/o. I keep trying to no avail. 

I've been staying positive for people. I've been in and out of therapy since I was 5 years old, so I know what to say. I've checked myself into pysch wards and rehabs over the years too though, nothing has taken away the overwhelming urge to end this. I've tried to get better. I really have. But I would be the 5th suicide in my family anyways. 

So yeah, I'm passively killing myself. One of the main reasons paraplegics die is from a UTI turning to sepsis. For the past two months I've been waiting for it to kill me. I've done everything I can take make the infection worse. And yes, it's slowly getting worse.. but I am tired of fucking waiting.

I'm going to have the best year of my life. And then I'm going to kill myself,"I have c-PTSD and depression. I've gone to therapy. I've taken the meds. I'm more social now and I'm in college studying something I genuinely love.

Then, I'm going to drive somewhere beautiful and secluded in the mountains, I'm going to watch the sunset. I'll text a final goodbye to my sister and my best friend. I'm going to call 911 to tell them where to find my body, and I'm going to shoot myself.

I don't know if I'm losing my mind but I feel like I can trust no one so I feel completely alone,"Please help me.

I am lately more convinced that I cannot trust anyone not even my mum. That everyone would betray or hurt me. It makes me feel completely alone and like exiting life.

My mum has always been a good hardworking mother but lately she's done a few things.

For me physical touch is a big trigger since I have bad memories associated with it. But positive touch is also something I crave.

She never used to hug us. She has expressed regret about this. We were just that kind of family, no affection.

Now when I hug her, she sometimes puts her hands too close to my butt or chest. I'm usually the one who always initiates hugs. I keep thinking I'm paranoid. Why would even my own mum treat me like this? Like subtly disrespect my boundaries.

She was abused sexually when she was a young woman. Physically as a kid.

Once I was telling her how I want a cat and how I would cradle the cat like a baby. Out of nowhere she said, ""You have me, I'll be your cat!"" Walked around the table to where i was standing, and suddenly hugged me and put her head on my chest. She never did this before or since. It was random and felt uncomfortable.

Once I told her I don't want to hug and she took it as an insult, seemed genuinely hurt. I said that it's cause my hair was smelly. But the truth is she had just hugged me with her hand too close to my chest, like touching the underarm.

She said if I say that it bothers me somehow then she'll never hug me again. She seemed insulted. 

When as a kid I told her how relatives had inappropriately touched my crotch and butt, she told me they meant no harm. But she seemed shocked and kept asking me if they had done something worse. But then it just was brushed under the rug.

She regularly talks about true crime and says how disgusting abusers are.

She called me a whore for staying out late a few years ago in my 20s. When i was younger she'd refuse to let me have a social life, telling me in a mocking tone, ""What for? So you go open your legs and get pregnant??"" Lately she said she was just trying to protect me from ""going down a bad path"" and encourages me to go out now.

But other than those instances she has been a very good, patient, hardworking mum.

Everyone in my life has hurt me. In confusing ways. Why would the same people who are so kind to me then treat me like an OBJECT, an unfeeling thing?

I woke up around 4am with strong thoughts of exiting, cause I feel completely alone.

How do I talk about suicide Without being committed?,"For the first time ever I decided I need help and tried 2 crisis lines today, the first felt like scripted answers and responses and gave me a link to a ""mental health center"" that's only open while I'm working. The second seemed more human but then said they were going to call emergency services because I was at risk (I'm at risk every day) and I had to beg them not to and convince them I'd talk to my wife and be fine (I didn't and I'm not).
Every therapist I've talked to has stated ""fully confidential unless you're a threat to yourself"". 
So I can't be honest because I am a threat to myself? Online says to go to the ER or call 911.
All of these result in being committed to psychiatric inpatient, say that happens, they stop me from killing myself, then they extend my stay because I still want to kill myself. Then I lose my job for missing work, my wife blames herself (she already has mental health issues) and can't trust leaving me alone with my son. I convince the doc to let me go and I'm jobless and lose my family then I definitely will kill myself. OR I have a vehicle accident, insurance pays off my mortgage, my wife doesn't blame herself, win win. That just feels like a better option. If I talk to a professional,  they'll want to commit me, if I talk to anyone I know they'll call 911 and I'll get committed.

Very ugly 33 year old male virgin who doesn’t leave the house because if last treatment,"Male aged 33)

I’m 6ft tall long legs short torso slim black hair receding hairline so yea I’m fucked

Never even touched a girl or spoke a word to or by one since 2012 and that was coworkers who treated me like shit compared to other dudes

I never leave the house now except going the store nearby at night with my hood up and snood covering my face partly and they’re fine with it.

2012-2015: world in a bar (Wetherspoons) it was great at first but then it went horrible. Women managers treating me like shit and bad mouthing me to the boss for nothing when the good looking guys could do no wrong and they’re all up their asses. Women customers 75% of the time were snobby and rude to me but when an attractive guy serves them they’re a different person. 

***One girl in there even said to me ‘we had a vote who we girls in here would stay away from and we picked you’ and then giggled (summed my time in there up)***

Guys were mostly good but I’d get the few ‘he’s an ugly bastard him’ comments when I walked away after serving them.

**Even before I had that job I had a job advisor who treated me poorly and made 0 effort  but put all the effort on to the prison hunky chads who sometimes were abusive. That still hurts to this day and it was ages ago**

I left and only did stadium jobs (decent money from it) 2-3 times a week and that was great at first then I noticed things like when I try to help a woman/girl they act all ‘😒’ and roll their eyes at me 

or avoid me and ask someone else further away for help was a regular occurrence 

Had instances where a girl would be with her dad for example and he’s say something to her about me then she’d look over at me and grimace with a disgusted look on her face and he’d be laughing at her playfully 

I’d go out thinking I’d look fine and we’ll and youthful even at 28 but I’d come back sitting still stiff for hours after some shifts at home :/

**▪️even on here I asked about my hairline once on malehairadvice and one comment said ‘very very ugly male’ while another replied to him ‘lol yea he’s clearly balding and hideous as fuck by the way’**

The pandemic came and I seen it a reason to not go out anymore 

***I now have a pink nose and I look even worse now***

I drink a 20cl bottle of scotch every night and smoke weed too (separately) as Iv nothing to look forward to.

I think it's time,Several stoic philosophers have touted suicide as a reasonable course of action when faced with something you cannot bear. I've come to that point.

I don't go to town. I don't talk to people. I spend every possible moment in the woods. Hunting or fishing during the off season. I will not be missed. The straw that broke the camels back is that I have no money. My disability hasn't been approved and I'm unable to work. I don't expect to live like a king but I require a certain standard of living. I'm not being afforded that so I'm going to simply shuffle off this mortal coil. I have abided as long as I can. The system is broken and has failed me.,OddYear368,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12k720d/i_think_its_time/,several stoic philosopher touted suicide reasonable course action faced something cannot bear come point mentally disabled physically wreck cocktail nine different medication keep alive mental breakdown interact society unless go town talk people spend every possible moment wood hunting fishing season missed straw broke camel back money disability approved unable work expect live like king require certain standard living afforded going simply shuffle mortal coil abided long system broken ha failed,think time,odd year 368
I will be Found in my House,"I think I'm done, to be honest. I've nothing to show for my life. No friends, no loved ones, nothing to be proud of. I'm completely and utterly alone. 

I saw a documentary, Dreams of A Life. It's about a woman who lay dead for over 2 years in her home and nobody noticed. The council was part paying her rent and her benefits were paying the bills to a degree. The only reason they found her was because of the only part payment of rent had run up arrears and they sent bailiffs round to repossess the place. 

They found her skeleton, sitting in front of a TV that was still on, surrounded by Christmas presents she never sent. She was in her early 40s...I'm 40 next year. 

And I just thought- ""that will be me"". No one will notice I'm gone. Maybe work will be annoyed if I don't show, but eventually they'll give up. And my body will just lie here and rot into the carpet. 

So why wait? I have nothing to lose, no one to miss me. I suppose it would be interesting to see if I go undetected for longer than 2 years or not. I'm not on benefits and my money may run out quicker. So I supposed the bailiffs will be round sooner. 

The next people to find me will be those who find my decaying corpse. That's the most depressing thing ever.",BlackLakeFreeFall,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12k0bzg/i_will_be_found_in_my_house/,think done honest nothing show life friend loved one nothing proud completely utterly alone saw documentary dream life woman lay dead 2 year home nobody noticed council wa part paying rent benefit paying bill degree reason found wa part payment rent run arrears sent bailiff round repossess place found skeleton sitting front tv wa still surrounded christmas present never sent wa early 40 40 next year thought one notice gone maybe work annoyed show eventually give body lie rot carpet wait nothing lose one miss suppose would interesting see go undetected longer 2 year benefit money may run quicker supposed bailiff round sooner next people find find decaying corpse depressing thing ever,found house,black lake free fall
Don't be so quick to involve people's family. They just might be the problem.,"Not everyone has a loving and supportive family. For a lot of us they are the cause of our depression. I struggle every day with horrible PTSD from my nightmare childhood. We went through an entire pandemic, years of holidays and birthdays has passed and not a single family member has checked in on me. Reaching out to people who for years didn't care to check if I was dead or alive, and them now suddenly pretending to care ONLY because other people are worried about my mental health is traumatic.

I know people's heart is in the right place. But we really need to stop assuming that we know someone's situation and what is best for them. A lot of people come from toxic families. There are people I love dearly, who I want absolutely nothing to do with. Involving them when I'm on the edge will only make me wanna jump more.",kaylalove05,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12jnlsq/dont_be_so_quick_to_involve_peoples_family_they/,everyone ha loving supportive family lot u cause depression struggle every day horrible ptsd nightmare childhood went entire pandemic year holiday birthday ha passed single family member ha checked reaching people year care check wa dead alive suddenly pretending care people worried mental health traumatic know people heart right place really need stop assuming know someone situation best lot people come toxic family people love dearly want absolutely nothing involving edge make wanna jump,quick involve people family might problem,kay la love 05

I was terminated for reporting racism &amp; sexual harassment. The humiliation from being fired alone is suicide within its-self.,"I was fired from my job after reporting sexual harassment, sexism &amp; racism. I had proof, I had witnesses, I was the only woman working with all men and I actually loved my job but sadly I couldn’t tolerate the harassment anymore. I was terminated after reporting all of this and the reason was because I wasn’t a “good fit”. It was humiliating. Being escorted out while the men I reported laughed at me … the worst feeling in the world. 

And now am being evicted. My lease is up in 4 months and my landlord won’t renew it. I am 25 years old and no family, literally NO FAMILY. I don’t have friends because I have always worked a lot. 

I am tired. I’ve been providing for myself since I was 16 years old, I’ve always been a hard working woman, I’ve always believed in doing the right thing and trying to get through life no matter how hard things got. But now I’m about to lose it all. I live in NYC and it’s damn near impossible to survive here. Being homeless when we already have a housing crisis &amp; over flooded shelters is terrifying. (please don’t tell me to move). 

I truly wish we lived in a society where help is offered to young adults. 

I love life so much. I actually wake up everyday blessed to be alive. I’ve helped people before who were suicidal … But now I’m realizing how I don’t have to deal with any of this anymore and it could all just end.",Softsweetflower,47,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12itdv5/i_was_terminated_for_reporting_racism_sexual/,wa fired job reporting sexual harassment sexism amp racism proof witness wa woman working men actually loved job sadly tolerate harassment anymore wa terminated reporting reason wa good fit wa humiliating escorted men reported laughed worst feeling world evicted lease 4 month landlord renew 25 year old family literally family friend always worked lot tired providing since wa 16 year old always hard working woman always believed right thing trying get life matter hard thing got lose live nyc damn near impossible survive homeless already housing crisis amp flooded shelter terrifying please tell move truly wish lived society help offered young adult love life much actually wake everyday blessed alive helped people suicidal realizing deal anymore could end,wa terminated reporting racism amp sexual harassment humiliation fired alone suicide within self,soft sweet flower
Forever Young,"My birthday is the end of May, so I still have time to end it now and be forever 25. I've been depressed/suicidal for most of my life, and struggle with hardcore substance addiction that has ruined everything around me. My boyfriend says he wants to see me grow old and happy. But I have a feeling that I've destroyed my life (and brain) to the point I can never recover. He said he would call me back two days ago, and never did. Our 2+ year relationship is toxic; I can't call him when I'm depressed because he thinks I'm being negative and it annoys him. Can't talk to my family because they hate me too. My best friend is also depressed and suicidal... I'd rather die young and ""beautiful"" than live to be old and miserable. I'm going to die anyway, so why not take control and go out the way I want? At what age do I stop being young, anyways? 

&amp;#x200B;

My plan.... leave Mexico City, take a bus to the coast of Oaxaca. Write a suicide letter. 

Get my toxic combo of drugs and alcohol. Start off by taking 1-2 Ritalin and drinking some ale. Graduate to vodka and tequila. Finish off with a few bottles of wine, paired with lethal doses of Morphine and Clonazepam. By this point it will be dark outside, and by the early hours of the morning I walk to the beach and am taken over by the powerful currents of  the beautiful ocean (my happy place) ... No one will be around or awake to stop me or save me, and even if someone managed to get me out the water, I'd be dead from the lethal overdose. Only part that bothers me is thinking of the way my body would look after floating in the water for too long, but then again, once I'm dead, it won't matter. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm leaving some details out but that's been my plan for a while now.

Lost it over a cookie.,"Everything goes wrong these days for me, nothing works as it is supposed to. Most of the times I cause my misfortunes which is why I am so down lately. But even luck isn't on my side these days. Things happen like a bus never showing up, sudden rain when I am out and generally small things that didn't use to get to me, but they now do. I feel like I live on a constant April's fool joke.

The other day I had a coffee and a cookie delivered to me. I opened the bag and I saw two cookies. They added an extra cookie. Instead of being happy for this gift, I had a breakdown. I thought that even that didn't work as it should and then everything else that goes wrong in my life came to mind and I had a breakdown...

Depression or current events?,"I just feel desperate for coping tips, uplifting thoughts, counter perspectives or to commiserate. I realize I may be feeling this way because of my mindset/perspective. But I honestly struggle to find a reason to stay on the hamster wheel here. 

* I have no degree. I considered going back to school but seems to just bring on more debt.

* I got lucky enough to score a union job that pays reasonably well  ($40/hr) but I live in one of the most expensive cities in the world.  

* I grew up poor and don't know money things but somehow I'm the most adept in my household. Because I can Google.   I know nothing of investing or anything useful.  I'm definitely failing my family here. I just got here by default. 

* This income is not enough to pay my expenses, pay down my debt, and save to own or barely even retire.  I have about 1k savings.  

* My ""lucky"" job is incredibly easy physically but the environment is toxic and destroys my mental state. I wake up with panic attacks and cry most days before my shift. The level of anxiety feels unhealthy. 


* I work the night shift and am incredibly burnt out. I've been here for 5 years and I miss the sun. Sleep never feels restful.

* I have a therapist, but I hes new in my life.  We haven't made much progress yet in our handful of seasons but before this I had a therapist for 2 years and even though I felt okay going back to work after the pandemic.. In a month I felt back to square 1 because I was back to the stressful enormous and surprise, all the breathing exercises are much easier to implement when you are practicing alone at home. 

* my housing isn't very stable, we rent and our lease expired in Feb. We've been month to month since and basically waiting for the other shoe to drop. We know the rent will be increased and can't afford it so have just been going month to month hoping to keep our rent rate.

* we are in debt (probably 30k between credit and bills).

* I'm over 35 and based on how it's going financially I probably won't be able to retire.  

* I'm going to work til I die or die from the stress of working. I feel so trapped. 

* I am terrified of the financial crisis in this country and am so scared ill not find a better position then this without education. If I leave here there's just a sea of fake job listing ands and endless qualifications that I don't have. Even the people around me with degrees have mentioned feeling like I do.

Everything just seems to get worse and worse.,"Since the end of last year I've gotten fired, forced to transfer schools, got dumped by my first and potentially only love, redeveloped my insomnia, I got into an accident and total'd my car, and I haven't been performing as well as I'd want academically. Well, I say that but I'm only doing ""well"" in one class.


I'm trying my best to study for my classes and exams but am unable to focus the majority of the time. I genuinely don't feel like I have anything going for me and even though I'm in therapy it's not helping as much as I thought it would. I can't deal with how everything feels like it's crashing down around me. I don't have a great support system, because if I talk to my parents or my family they just make things so much worse. 


Recently, alongside my mother, my dad also called and basically just called me worthless and says everything bad happening to me is my fault, and if I don't do something to change it I'm gonna kill myself and he won't be surprised. My mother also took half an hour just now to reaffirm everything he said and talked about how I'm not just ruining my life but also my brother's  cause I'm not setting a good example for him nor am I raising him right. They're always taking the liberty of painting themselves as trying their hardest to raise me and doing everything for me and I'm just ruining it all. Funnily, they never raised me themselves, it was either babysitter or I was on my own, all they ever provided was the standard things you're supposed to do as a parent, minus any sort of emotional support or nurturing. Honestly, I never asked to be alive. I never asked to be here on earth. But, they decided to bring someone they weren't ready to raise and didn't want, and made sure I knew that I wasn't wanted, onto this stupid planet and now I have to deal with it. 


I'm trying to be a good person, I swear. I do my best to stay kind to everyone, I'm trying my best to keep myself appearing happy around my friends and being there for them or whoever else needs it. Maybe it's all just me being selfish though and I'm not actually trying. 


But at this point I'm just waking up every day and trying to survive one more.

Im not sure if im going to unalive myself today but i feel like i will,"I have a bad english and ortography so im really sorry if anyone reads this.

I have everything to make it and i already  tested once and it should work, anyways im still scared of doing it. Im very confused about the reason im doing this, i dont know if is because i hate myself, because im trans and i basically hate how others perceives me, because of traumas of my past or because i feel guilty of everything bad that happens around me or smth like that. Also i feel guilty of doing this because i know some people may suffer at last a bit from this. Specially my mom, she is the best mom someone could ask for and im still here wanting to do it. The only thing im sure of is that she will suffer a lot because of me, as she always did, because im an horrible person(not because i want but because i dont understand how to do better) 

Anyways writing this makes me feel a little bit better about it because even if some people suffer, after some time they will forget my existence and without me they will be a lot more happier than with me present.

I hope my mom is happier after this, i really want her to be the happiest person alive as she always wants to be.

First and last post? Idk man i hope so 

(To everyone that's here reading this and feels like doing it to, please think about it, i know its strange to been told this from a person thats maybe already dead or about to do it but really, if i had a chance to feel like not doing it, i would take it and i hope anyone that is feeling this way could take it.)

What is the point of continuing if I have no drive. I have absolutely no motivation to do anything. I’m barely getting out of bed most days.,"Before I completely succumbed to depression I didn’t care about life’s meaning or my purpose. I just simply enjoyed living and went day to day without thinking too much. I genuinely wonder what happened to me for that all to stop. Why did my motivation disappear? 

I’ve known since I was young that the world wasn’t perfect and that people struggle. But maybe I didn’t fully realize the weight that fear can place on your shoulders. I’m afraid of disappointing others. I’m so scared of people confronting me about failure. I don’t know how to get over this. I shut down in conversations that I find uncomfortable. I can’t have a serious conversation about my future without experiencing intense anxiety.

But it still doesn’t add up. How could I be left with no motivation at all? It’s not as if I don’t care about myself, I workout and try to fill my body with nutrients, have good hygiene, etc. . But I have no energy, no will to do anything. Medicine hasn’t helped. I’m just so lost. I don’t understand myself. Why was I so successful as a kid, only to fail in college. I just can’t fathom recovering from here. I experience so much shame and guilt. I don’t know if I have the determination to keep getting up everyday.",Rainy_tide,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12k3xtk/what_is_the_point_of_continuing_if_i_have_no/,completely succumbed depression care life meaning purpose simply enjoyed living went day day without thinking much genuinely wonder happened stop motivation disappear known since wa young world perfect people struggle maybe fully realize weight fear place shoulder afraid disappointing others scared people confronting failure know get shut conversation find uncomfortable serious conversation future without experiencing intense anxiety still add could left motivation care workout try fill body nutrient good hygiene etc energy anything medicine helped lost understand wa successful kid fail college fathom recovering experience much shame guilt know determination keep getting everyday,point continuing drive absolutely motivation anything barely getting bed day,rainy tide

I’m just a fuck up who needs to leave and make everyone’s lives easier without my bullshit. I don’t need to damage anyone else’s world more. This whole world is too hard for me and I long for a release from it. I wish I was stronger but I’m not. No one will care when I’m gone. It’s better this way because my depression and mentally ill thinking won’t bother anyone again. This is another suicide note to go along with one I’ve already written. I give up. It’s all to much. I just want peace, and I hate that I had to hurt the ones I love for so long before I realized what the right choice was. Sorry this was so long and so pointless but I hope you have a good life because you deserve it, I don’t. Because I know how pointless, worthless, and awful I am.

I'm just sick and tired of everything.,"My internship is about to end in June, and despite it being 9 months (August 2022-June 2023), it will not turn into anything full-time. I don't know how frequently internships lead to full time, but I kinda believed that it would be more likely if I did my best. I was offered a theatre production internship last summer. My area of expertise is lights, but it feels like this production internship has ended up being 10% lights and 90% scenery, and I am not that good at building. I felt like I did do my best despite the majority of the work being outside of my expertise, but it feels like it's never enough. I often feel like my workplace has hired me by mistake. What's even worse is my co-workers that are also interns seem to be getting something full-time after this, but yet I won't. I also live with these interns as well, but they both utterly despise me, which makes being at home difficult. They can also be pretty mean and bossy as well. It also makes me dread going to work on certain days, and it also makes me wish I was dead. I really only have a handful of friends near where I live, and I really only get to see them around once a week on average, since they don't have the same workplace as me.

I'm at a point where medince won't help, therapy won't help, self harm doesn't help, eating doesn't help, drinking doesn't help, exercise doesn't help. I can't afford a decent care center, and the last free one I was in made me worse off than when I'd gotten there. Plus I don't have the time to go into inpatient for a week or two...

Exit Ramp?,"I’ve not been suicidal since my late teens, and that was 40+ years ago…back when Prince was coming up. In the past 25 years, I have become completely life-weary, and am now planning my exit. This would have occurred 20 years ago, but I sought the role of being the sole guardian and support to my now 23 year old son. A bright and friendly kid with a cognitive impairment. His mother pretty much “checked” out of his life and General mothering when he was 3, forcing his polio-riddled mother to lead the way in care and support.


I recognized this, took custody, and raised him alone, all while trying to work full time. I shifted to working from home, so I could get to his school if support was needed  placing my personal life on hold. I took lesser paying jobs in exchange for being able to work at home (years before Covid). Then is was Medicaid (when private insurance for part time) became more of an issue. Finally, it was food assistance, to supplement us.


Between speech therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy and occupational therapy, I watching what little savings I had evaporate. Now, at age 23, my son sees how we struggle, and carries the worry I try to minimize from him seeing. 


I’ve not dated in 20 years, and my two remaining and best friends died 24 months apart. I have no emotional support for myself, and as much as I try to keep the topics of money out conversations with my son, they come in. The kind soul with a great sense of optimism he has is fading, supplanted by fears of homelessness.


The last couple of jobs in the professional sector’s I have experience in, I lost assignments to younger talent. And at 58, I can’t compete.


Retirement will never ever be an option, and I refuse to be the ball and chain that drags my son down to the depths of despair or homelessness. 


However, I was recently speaking to my son’s uncle, a kind man a couple of decades younger than me. I’ve had some health scares in the last few years, and he said if I ever became debilitated or incapacitated, he would step in, and care for my son. 


If this is possible, I’d like to plan to transition away from this world. Thinks will, with all and great likelihood, never improve for me. I’ll end up deeper into the system, likely in shelters at best.


If I know my son is with good, caring and protecting people who are family, I’ll feel much more at peace when I leave here. I gave my son the best 20 years I had, and I am spent.


Call be burnt and hopeless, but I see no downside.


I have a simple plan of driving to a scenic place and watching the sunset.

"Its all just false hope, I think I might do it","Dear Reddit,

I am a failure. The only relief for me is the double bass. Scott la faro, ray brown, jamie merit, PC; I want to be them or at least I did. I don’t think I can carry this weight. The Bulling, the disrespect, and that teacher who walked out on me, no one seems to like me or care for me. I am well off, I carry this debt from my parents and my grandparents. Names on buildings and everything. But, I fell down the hole and I am at the bottom. I might feel a bit better sometimes but, I am still in this hole. 

I have lost all respect for myself. “Above all, do not lie to yourself, a man who lies to himself loses respect for not just himself but for others.” Father Zossima was right. I am just a no good fool like fyodor. My only relief is pissing, shitting, nicotine and Bill Evans. This depersonalization is real, I am just a shell now. Fuck this decrepit excuse.

It won't get better,"They always say ""suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem"" or ""it'll get better"". But for me, it won't. I will always be autistic. I will never 'fit in'. I'll never be able to make friends. I will never be interested in or capable of being in a romantic or sexual relationship. So, what is left for me in life? Working? Eating? Sleeping? What a miserable existence.

I have been dealing with passive suicidal ideation ever since I had this realization. And, honestly, I don't believe anyone can help me. No amount of therapy or medication will get rid of the fact that I am different on a fundamental level. I also can't end my life, both out of lack of an easily available method and the effect that it will have on my family. I'm so young, I have ""so much to live for"", so I know that it would be very damaging if I decided to go through with it. I know that these thoughts will eventually lead to me deciding to end my life, despite the ramifications. 

So yeah, that's where I'm at right now. I would talk to someone in real life, but that hasn't been of much help. All I got were the same generic statements (""What are positive things about yourself?"" ""What are your goals in life?"" ""It'll  get better"")and the treatment of autism as 'being different' instead of as a disability that affects all aspects of my life. Can anyone help? I can't live like this much longer.",Subject_Bottle7538,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12k8fjm/it_wont_get_better/,always say suicide permanent solution temporary problem get better always autistic never fit never able make friend never interested capable romantic sexual relationship left life working eating sleeping miserable existence dealing passive suicidal ideation ever since realization honestly believe anyone help amount therapy medication get rid fact different fundamental level also end life lack easily available method effect family young much live know would damaging decided go know thought eventually lead deciding end life despite ramification yeah right would talk someone real life much help got generic statement positive thing goal life get better treatment autism different instead disability affect aspect life anyone help live like much longer,get better,subject bottle 7538

"26, going to rehab this year after detoxing from benzodiazepines. I spend every day thinking about the time I've wasted in my 20s and the bridges I've burned. I'm basically having a quarter life crisis.","(Warning : rambling and venting paragraphs ahead)
I live in Ireland and the rehab I'm going to is a medical facility by law, there are nurses and psychologists there etc.

I've been looking forward to it because I've been addicted to benzo drugs since my late teens, I went to community college twice, then had to drop of of the ""real"" college that I worked hard to get into because by benzo addiction was severe at that point, everyone around me knew something was off so I had to move back home.

I basically have no human contact with my friends from college because they've mostly moved on with their lives and it's been a few years.

Community college was probably the best time of my life. I always thinkg back and get severely depressed that those great times will never happen again. I'm 26 now and I'll be in rehab for almost a year and then going into an aftercare programme where I can try to find accomadation.

Sounds great and all but the future is fucking terrifying. What job am I going to do? For the last year something has been severely wrong with me because I don't really take joy in any of my hobbies anymore. Videogames barely even interest me at all.

I used to like to produce music, and I actually managed to get a fanbase due to my music being on youtube channels and spotify playlists with lots of followers. It was like a dream come true even though it was a small underground thing. it was just a small group of fans who liked my art, and I haven't made any music since 2020. I've always wanted to be a musician as a kid and now I couldn't care less anymore, and everyone who used to listen to all my stuff eventually forgot about me too.

Now I'm supposed to be moving to a rehab clinic for almost a whole year and I have no idea what comes after that. I rang the suicide hotline twice this week. I''ve been taking high amounts of Pregabalin, and I've been drinking more than I ever have because I'm isolated in this horrible house in the countryside alone in my room and have developed agoraphobia due to isolating myself and also due to the withdrawal during my medically assisted valium detox with my doctor.

I've basically been suicidal for a while, and I'm supposed to be detoxing from benzos but I'm drinking so much to suppress the racing and terrifying thoughts. I've tried suicide once last year and wasn't successful. Just surrounded by four walls in a shitty bedroom and trying to distract myself by scouring the internet to distract myself.",Hey-Gang,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12jy1kp/26_going_to_rehab_this_year_after_detoxing_from/,warning rambling venting paragraph ahead live ireland rehab going medical facility law nurse psychologist etc looking forward addicted benzo drug since late teen went community college twice drop real college worked hard get benzo addiction wa severe point everyone around knew something wa move back home basically human contact friend college mostly moved life year community college wa probably best time life always thinkg back get severely depressed great time never happen 26 rehab almost year going aftercare programme try find accomadation sound great future fucking terrifying job going last year something ha severely wrong really take joy hobby anymore videogames barely even interest used like produce music actually managed get fanbase due music youtube channel spotify playlist lot follower wa like dream come true even though wa small underground thing wa small group fan liked art made music since 2020 always wanted musician kid care le anymore everyone used listen stuff eventually forgot supposed moving rehab clinic almost whole year idea come rang suicide hotline twice week taking high amount pregabalin drinking ever isolated horrible house countryside alone room developed agoraphobia due isolating also due withdrawal medically assisted valium detox doctor basically suicidal supposed detoxing benzos drinking much suppress racing terrifying thought tried suicide last year successful surrounded four wall shitty bedroom trying distract scouring internet distract,26 going rehab year detoxing benzodiazepine spend every day thinking time wasted 20 bridge burned basically quarter life crisis,hey gang

I feel like it's my only way out,"I'm going to be homeless in 6 months. I'm going to be permanently physically separated from two friends I live with currently. I also have a partner, who is autistic. And isn't prepared to be or survive as a homeless person. He needs social services. And idk how to get them for him. His family is no help.

And my own service providers basically want me to abandon these people and save myself which goes against who I am as a person. 

I'm losing my friends. I can't help my partner survive. I may end up completely alone, homeless forever. And I say forever because I can't work because of my mental health issues. So I have no way to get out of a shelter. SSI is just not enough. And the only shelter accessible to me is meant to be temporary. So I'll get kicked out eventually.

I'm losing everything. At this point I'm convinced suicide is the only solution. But I'm so scared of pain. I recently learned of a method that is supposed to be relatively painless. But I would need to do it before becoming homeless. And idk how or where I would do it.

There is no upwards for me. This is it, I have nothing  left after this. I just want to die. I need to die. I need this painful existence to be over. Why isn't assisted suicide widely available. It seems cruel to be condemned to either live in suffering and destitution, prison, or die painfully by self executed suicide.

I'm still not quite sure he understands though, we spoke about it being egoistic to commit suicide even though family or friends are alive and I guess it is.

They block you from choosing to end your life, people care about blocking your access to methods much more than they care about actually helping. I feel manic, crazy, suicidal, I try to express it and nobody cares.



They only care when I start Googling the supplies for a painless death, bottom line people want to do it regardless and just stopping the act leaves people still alone with the feelings. People may just turn to less lethal methods, that cause more damage than good.

A rant.,"I don’t like being told that I should love myself and be grateful for being alive when nobody else feels that way about me. Even as a kid I was like the opposite of a magnet. 

Like people think that when I say nobody likes me that I’m being dramatic or overthinking. Like no I have a bad personality, a bad vibe. I could go on and on about everything that makes me a bad person. It’s a really sick game. It’s all cyclical and it’s a trap.

I lost the genetic lottery which is bad enough and I have no personality or charm to make up for it, I'm a drain on my family and a waste of space.

I don't think my daughter's enough to keep me here anymore,"For the longest time, she's been my only reason to stay. She's 7 now, and the fact that so far, she's grown up happy and sociable is the thing I'm most proud of. She hasn't lived with me for almost 2 years since my ex and I broke up, but considering my ex has her own issues too, I'm so proud of what we've both done. We're better than our parents were.

Lately though, every time she stays with me, I realise so little of that is actually down to me. I might be better than my parents were, but that doesn't mean I'm not still a failure as a father.

I can barely muster the energy to make the most of the time we have together. By the end of thr second day, I'm so exhausted I struggle to even draw with her. She hasn't stayed with me longer than 4 days, but by the 4th day after bringing her home, I'm just so mentally drained I can barely function. I can't do this.

My ex sees it too. She's genuinely amazing and the best thing that ever happened to me, but even she sees that I can't do this. I'm not cut out to be a parent. I can't take care of myself, let alone anyone else.

My ex is married now to a really great guy. He's so caring and a wonderful influence on my daughter too. He's providing them both with a much happier, more stable environment than I could ever provide.

I feel like we're at the point where they'd just be better off not having me hold them back. They'll be better off without having to think about a failure like me.

I’ll be 17 in a week and I just relapsed.,"I have so many plans. They’re all horrible. All painful. And they all rely on something like a stroke or internal bleeding. 

I cut myself after over a month of being clean. My mom must know somehow, because when I was crying in the bathroom and she yelled at me through the door, “Cutting won’t do anything. Stop playing the victim. You need to grow up.” She also came back a bit later and told me how fat and lazy I was. 

My parents don’t know I cut. Or at least I’ve never told them. But given what she says it looks like my mom knows. She just doesn’t care. That’s why I didn’t tell anyone. I knew they wouldn’t care. 

My dad asked me why I was upset a few hours later. Seems like my mom didn’t tell him. Neither did I. I don’t want him to know I cut just yet. But it doesn’t matter. He thinks I’m spoiled too. 

I told myself I wouldn’t cut until after my birthday. So I could have a good day. I’m supposed to get a massage for my birthday. Not only will my mom see but the massagers will also see. I don’t care anymore. Maybe they should see. Call me selfish, but I want them to know I’m suffering.

"Two-Sided Problem - Help Me to Convince Myself to Stop Harassing My Unrequited Lover, and Also to Stop Justifying it with “I’m Resigned to My Fate Anyway”","I’m writing this in the process of seeking help for myself, but perhaps this might also provide some insight into the internal suffering of those who partake in harassment. The title says it all. I'll provide the shortest possible version, but I will answer any questions and provide more details accordingly.
I met this woman (30F, Cambodian) when I (23M, Canadian) was having my gap term in Cambodia last year. (Forget about why I love her, that's not important). We hit it off massively for about 2 months and made a lot of future plans, but she became emotionally distant when I returned home. Last October, I tried to tell her that I was returning in February for more volunteering, (but with online courses), but she said she wouldn't have time. At that point, things became very difficult; my patience faltered, I suggested we take a break from talking, and I accused her of playing games with me, (while still trying to be polite and reasonable; although I disguised it, this was in fact a desperate plea to prevent her from leaving), to which she responded angrily and said she didn't want to talk anymore. It should have ended there. It was a bit crippling, and my mental state was worsened even further by the disintegration of my family, school stress and a subsequent quarter-life cris which only drove me further into isolation, which only caused me to think about her more, which caused me to cling on even more to the hope of starting a new life abroad by developing my connections in Cambodia. That's how it began.
We didn't talk again until February, although I tried to hold on to her with a Happy New Year message and a few others. When I attempted to reconnect upon arriving, she finally admitted that she was with her new French boyfriend, whom she met at almost the exact same time as me (l'm quite certain he had a girlfriend at the time whom he was with, and unlike me, he was just doing backpacking and amateur photography for 30 days) and whom she visited in France the previous September (I later discovered all those details from social media stalking; she never mentioned a word of it to me).
Being rejected, that was bad enough - but being discarded, abandoned, devalued and written off in favour of someone else? That was so much worse. So... now what? Like I said, quarter-life crisis. I didn't feel like I had a choice at any point along the line.
Although my initial response was composed, things got worse very quick and I had numberous emotional meltdowns in the late hours of the evening, which led to a lot of unhinged emails and DM's. This was when things became abusive and hostile. This later escalated to phone calls. Same response every time. Block. Block. Block. I was so resigned to the situation that I would keep saying
""Just do it, I know you're going to"" or ""my bet is on 30 seconds this time.""
When I am in a more rational mindset, I am constantly shocked by what I see on my phone, I am fighting with myself to stop, and I feel a sense of unbearable remorse - but the cycle keeps repeating itself on every impulse and trigger. I seem to remember every episode well enough, but l'm in a state of dissociation, so l'm only watching myself do it. All of these are red flags for Borderline Personality Disorder, of which I was also a victim (because of my mother).
She's already talked about reporting me to the police if I continue, but I did. The reasons are complicated.
I'm not entirely convinced that they (especially in the 3rd-world) would take this seriously due to the absence of threats, sexual harassment and physical stalking, (which only compounds the remorse, because I know full well that this is wrong solely because of the pain I'm inflicting, consequences aside), and if the worst case scenario did occur, I'm not inclined to care anyway because my out-of-control suicidal ideation. I ruined everything, who cares? No consequences if I’m dead.
Unfortunately l'm cut off from medical care and mental heath resources until return home, but I am trying to connect with a therapist here (at great cost) to find a temporary solution anyway. Now I'm writing this because I want to find anything that would distract me from writing to her again, I want someone to get some empathy through my thick head so I understand fully the impact, I want to believe that I'm better than this, and I want to change my ways. ChatGPT has also been giving good advice, but I want it from a real person. If you belittle me, I don't care. I probably deserve it anyway.
This is an intervention. Under NO circumstances am I to show up at her house. Stop me now before that happens.

I don’t want to leave my therapist,"I’m currently in college, and the therapist that I see is through the school. So once I graduate, I won’t be able to see him anymore.

I’ve seen a lot of different therapists, and he’s the best one I’ve had. I was hospitalized twice for suicidal thoughts and had issues with my parents after both visits (plus a lot of other issues), so I stopped trusting people after a while. He’s worked with me for about a year and a half trying to help me improve my trust and communication, and I’ve gotten much better. I still have suicidal thoughts though, but talking with him helps. In the past, therapists have mentioned sending me to the hospital the minute I mention suicidal thoughts (no matter the degree), so I never felt like I could talk about them. My therapist now asks a lot of questions and really tries to understand what’s happening. I feel safe having fully honest conversations about my thoughts with him, and I genuinely feel like he has my best interest in mind.

I’m worried though that when I have to find a new therapist, that they’ll automatically send me to the hospital the second I mention suicidal thoughts. And honestly, after the first two visits I’m afraid that a third will leave me worse off. It’s hard finding a therapist who can actually talk about suicide.",InstructionSalty7184,6,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12jdcr5/i_dont_want_to_leave_my_therapist/,currently college therapist see school graduate able see anymore seen lot different therapist best one wa hospitalized twice suicidal thought issue parent visit plus lot issue stopped trusting people worked year half trying help improve trust communication gotten much better still suicidal thought though talking help past therapist mentioned sending hospital minute mention suicidal thought matter degree never felt like could talk therapist asks lot question really try understand happening feel safe fully honest conversation thought genuinely feel like ha best interest mind worried though find new therapist automatically send hospital second mention suicidal thought honestly first two visit afraid third leave worse hard finding therapist actually talk suicide,want leave therapist,instruction salty 7184
It's really about what is pragmatic at this point,"Dealing with homelessness can drive anyone insane.

It has been 6 years of this. Last year I met a man and we are engaged and have been toughing it out together since then. He was also homeless when we met.

I'm disabled. I cannot drive a vehicle. He was able to find work and he can drive. But we can hardly make ends meet, still have to go from spot to spot, motel to motel, or sleep in the car some nights.

When winter comes, we will have nothing left, and may succumb to the weather.

We have called many organizations that assist the homeless to no avail.

I have posted my paypal link on various threads. I have tried selling my music to no avail. Anything to make ends meet. Anything to get assistance.

We are at the end of our rope, and we don't want to suffer anymore. Suicide seems to be a logical choice if we want any semblance of choice over how we die. I don't even want to have to die by suicide, but I don't want to die undignified huddled up for warmth crying in a cold car next to my partner, or worse yet, separated at the hospital dying of an infection because we can't get proper medical care as homeless people.

I just want to make it look like an accident. He and I have discussed going out together by choice, and not just waiting around to die. I don't know what to do. We don't have much in terms of money, friends, family, so our options for help are extremely limited. 

I don't even know that I want to die, aside from the fact that I am disabled and often feel like just a burden, but I feel like my disability wouldn't even affect me as much if a landlord would just rent to us.

Had suicidal thoughts for the first time,"For a month, I have had anxious thoughts about my relationship with my boyfriend as he suggested a break but we didn't go through with it as we broke up for a day, realised we loved each other and had a conversation on how to make the relationship stronger (more effective communication and expressing our needs - it has been improving). The thoughts went along the lines of ""he doesn't like you"" and ""this text is about we need to break up I bet you"". These thoughts then turned into focusing on my failing academia which quickly focused on having no future. This didn't effect me at work until this week. As I was cleaning, the negative thoughts came back for two hours and sucidial thoughts began (this was worse as i work near the sea) as well as two near break downs. It only stopped as a coworker talked to me. 

Ever since I went to the gym this morning, I've felt better about myself. I have also enquired a counselling session at my uni. Just now, my bf asked if he could come with me to town as I need to get some things and I could feel myself welling up. This part was over text so I'm glad he didn't see me almost tear up by a simple message. 

During my life, I have been bullied and only felt feelings lonliness and worthlessness for 10 minutes when I was 15. My dad quickly got me to do something with him. I was bullied for 5 years (picked on for 2 at sixth form) and I tried to stay as strong as possible for my friends and family as one of my best friends was being bullied too. My first job didn't go well. I was getting used to being happy again and not having to worry (also my voice was monotone, so I was trying to get out of that too) and on my last two shifts I was ostracised by the entire team (this caused me to break down at work during my break).",ObjectiveHelpful1274,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12jzf01/had_suicidal_thoughts_for_the_first_time/,month anxious thought relationship boyfriend suggested break go broke day realised loved conversation make relationship stronger effective communication expressing need ha improving thought went along line like text need break bet thought turned focusing failing academia quickly focused future effect work week wa cleaning negative thought came back two hour sucidial thought began wa worse work near sea well two near break stopped coworker talked ever since went gym morning felt better also enquired counselling session uni bf asked could come town need get thing could feel welling part wa text glad see almost tear simple message life bullied felt feeling lonliness worthlessness 10 minute wa 15 dad quickly got something wa bullied 5 year picked 2 sixth form tried stay strong possible friend family one best friend wa bullied first job go well wa getting used happy worry also voice wa monotone wa trying get last two shift wa ostracised entire team caused break work break,suicidal thought first time,objective helpful 1274

How do I go on,"Hello there, I’ve been suicidal most of my life. For many of the years I did get help (therapy, CBT, antidepressants). And was misdiagnosed for a long time. I was told that I’ve got depression and anxiety. After many many years, I was then informed (after I’d had a crisis), that’s what I had is borderline personality disorder.

I have kept my symptoms manageable, just about by using medical cannabis. But this has become too much of a crutch. The last year has been extremely difficult. My father died young and unexpectedly. I had severe coronavirus(upto 8pm the currently), which has meant that I missed both of my children’s birthdays, and I’ve seen my general health take such a downturn that I was sure that I would not survive it. 

I then unfairly lost my job. I’m still not any clearer as to why I was let go, but I’m fairly sure it was because I hurt someone’s ego. Since then, everything has continued to be difficult, during which my wife needed my support, and I have failed to give her this. This is because I was still stuck in my own thoughts, still unwell with coronavirus, and feeling like a failure, because of how many difficulties continue to turn up.

We have two children, and there’s been some difficulties around those guys as well, my wife works really hard, to educate them because they’re home educated. And she’s done so fantastically with that, I still failed to understand and acknowledge how much pain and difficulty she was suffering from. 

A week ago, she told me to leave the house, and even though over the last year, I kept telling myself, that “it will get better, it will definitely get better, I won’t have the hardest time forever, I’m a good person and I deserve to do The things I want to do with my life rather than feel like I’m not gonna get anywhere”. In the end though, all the problems have not ceased. 

I’ve been fighting really hard to ignore the, suicidal ideation in my mind. But I’m now a point where I don’t know what to do, my wife needs to move on with her life. When I think about my kids, all I can see is that I bring them pain. I miss them all so much, I just want to make everyone happy.

I’ve realised I’ve got a number of flaws within myself, but I don’t know how I can overcome them. 

I’m just not good enough to be here, I’m a nutjob and I ruin everything around me. God, I wish I could go back to 5 years ago and focus on just living happily with my wife. God, I wish I’d spent the time listening to her, about how she’s struggling, and how much she needs my help. I’m writing on Reddit today, because I believe that I will be going in the next few days. I just want to have one more day with my kids first. 

I wish there was a way that I could convince myself it would get better, but every experience I’ve had recently just tells me I should go and let them all live free.

Is there anything anyone could say to help me please?",blainsapain,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12jhmmg/how_do_i_go_on/,hello suicidal life many year get help therapy cbt antidepressant wa misdiagnosed long time wa told got depression anxiety many many year wa informed crisis borderline personality disorder kept symptom manageable using medical cannabis ha become much crutch last year ha extremely difficult father died young unexpectedly severe coronavirus upto 8pm currently ha meant missed child birthday seen general health take downturn wa sure would survive unfairly lost job still clearer wa let go fairly sure wa hurt someone ego since everything ha continued difficult wife needed support failed give wa still stuck thought still unwell coronavirus feeling like failure many difficulty continue turn two child difficulty around guy well wife work really hard educate home educated done fantastically still failed understand acknowledge much pain difficulty wa suffering week ago told leave house even though last year kept telling get better definitely get better hardest time forever good person deserve thing want life rather feel like gonna get anywhere end though problem ceased fighting really hard ignore suicidal ideation mind point know wife need move life think kid see bring pain miss much want make everyone happy realised got number flaw within know overcome good enough nutjob ruin everything around god wish could go back 5 year ago focus living happily wife god wish spent time listening struggling much need help writing reddit today believe going next day want one day kid first wish wa way could convince would get better every experience recently tell go let live free anything anyone could say help please,go,bla sapa

I hate my life because of my birth defects,"I am an adult with a variety of rare birth defects. I've tried to join support groups, but the groups for one of my most troublesome defects are inactive. The other groups are just absolutely full of parents. What about my peers??

I've been stuck for years seeking answers and care from specialists. All of the questions used to be answered with ""we don't know, you'll find out when you're older.""

Now I'm older, and I STILL DON'T KNOW anything about my anomalies and how my body works. I'm scared, I experience severe pain, and I just hate existing. 

I've felt hopeless, anxious, depressed, suicidal, and different for my ENTIRE life. I have tried many medications for mental illnesses throughout the years. They either just don't work or give me horrible symptoms. 

I don't think it's a matter of an imbalance in my brain. I think it's the lack of support and childhood trauma.

In therapy, I often feel like my therapy sessions are awkward and fruitless when I discuss my issues with my birth defects. 

Now that I'm an adult, my parents stress that my appointments and tests should be ""all on me."" I get very overwhelmed, and sometimes I'd just rather neglect everything. 

I don't think it's right to freeze your child out the moment they become an adult and refuse to emotionally support them while they're struggling with birth defects that you CHOSE to bring them into the world with. But what do I know?

I just feel stuck and so tired. I think of suicide often. I've read that people with my defects can feel this way. I just don't know how to stop feeling like this.  Everything is so complicated and overwhelming, and I've been sick it all for my entire life. 

When I try to explain how I feel about things to family, friends, lovers, etc. nobody really gets it, and I have been treated as a burden when I have uncontrollable symptoms from my defects. 

I've been told by my parents and other family members that I ""cry wolf"" because I express that I want to die but have made no attempts that hospitalized me.

I'm scared because my suicidal ideation has been getting increasingly more finalized and cold.

How do you stop the feelings?,"How do you stop the pit in your stomach, knowing you’ve disappointed someone again?
How do you stop the worthlessness creeping in?
How do you stop the desire to turn off your mind, the feelings, everything?
How do you stop yourself from slipping into the void and ending it?

Stupid things. Stupid little things. I do so many stupid things that disappoint and then I just feel so unworthy. 
I grew up in a home where I was used, abused, and neglected. I don’t know how to love right. I don’t know how to respond “normally”. I do things defensively or naively because *I genuinely have no idea what is normal or what I’m supposed to do.* 
And then when I mess up the tiniest thing with someone, I hide. I run and hide. Because it takes me straight back to waiting for the bat or belt to come out or my door to creak open in the middle of the night. My responses to things aren’t to irritate or be selfish… it’s because in that moment I thought it was what *you* wanted from me. I was trained to assess needs, be what was needed, do what was needed, and shut up. 

How do you stop all of that?

How do you find the strength to get better? (serious question),"My problems are stupid but they overwhelm me. I want to find an answer but I can’t and any time I try to do something to get better I end up failing.
I tried talking to a therapist but it’s not for me, I can’t make it work. It’s been more than two years and I can’t believe I am still struggling. How can I even hope that this will be over one day? I know it’s all my fault and that anyone else in my shoes would have already solved everything but I can’t. I don’t know what to do.
I wished I could die because that’s the only way I could stop struggling but it would be too stupid to commit suicide for such a silly reason (plus it takes courage and it would ruin my family’s lives).
Which is why in the end all I want to do is find the strength to get better. Or be told that I’m hopeless and give up completely on life, stop trying to find answers. I feel awful to think that tomorrow I’ll wake up and it will be the same. Why do I have to feel so bad over things people normally handle with little/short-lived difficulty? Why do I have to waste so much time in my head, worrying and thinking without ever drawing conclusions?
I am just a stupid 19 yo struggling with self-identity, so don’t take me too seriously, but if you have any tips on how to get through hard times, I’d appreciate them.

I wanna take them and be rid of it all so bad. Only reason I haven't up until this point is because all I had was Tylenol which I know would be a slow and painful way to go. There have definitely been days where if I had access to the opioids I would've done it.

The only thing keeping me alive right now is that I cannot bare the thought of leaving my dog, or putting someone in a position to find me after unaliving myself. I just don’t know what more to do. I’m about to lose my health insurance, so I’m not sure how I can continue managing proper mental health care.

I want to feel better but I feel like it impossible so I feel like I have to give up. Anyone have advice on how to keep hanging on.,"Ive been dealing with mental illness since I was 6 I’m 17 now it started out with a depression diagnosis ive had a lot of misdiagnosis and stuff since but my current diagnosis are. High functioning autism, major depressive disorder, OCD, generalized anxiety disorder, ADD, and BPD. I only mention this because I feel it will be important to understand my complex story and why I don’t think things can get better. Ive dealt with self harm since I was 7 but my first suicide attempt was when I was 11 ive had multiple since then mostly overdoses. Ive been involuntarily hospitalized 10 times 1 of which at a 3 month facility non of them helped me. Ive tried tons of medicines at one point I was misdiagnosed with bipolar so they had me on lithium and they got me up to such a high dose 1800 milligrams a day that i had to see a kidney doctor and they determined I have stage 3 kidney disease from lithium toxicity. I no longer have the bipolar diagnosis they think it was actually BPD but point is ive tried so many medicines to help me in so many different areas some areas have improved but my depression never has. Ive even tried newer alternative medicines such as esketamine. My anxiety I’m on medicine for that helps slightly but not nearly enough but I don’t know what else I can do for it but I get so anxious at points I feel like to escape I have to kill myself. I recently got kicked out of my school because they thought I was to much of a danger to myself to be there and now I’m at home in my room all the time isolated without anyone to talk to because that was my only social circle. I didn’t go to a normal school I went to an autism center because I’m high functioning on the spectrum and I couldn’t handle regular school settings. Ive always had issues with self harm but since I got kicked from my school it’s been really bad. I had a lot of child trauma not from my family because fortunately I was adopted by good parents but I was bullied a lot when I was in public school and in 2nd grade I dealt with SA and it affects the way I think about people to this day I’m scared of people i don’t know. My current plan that I made with my doctor and family is in 3 weeks I’m getting checked in for ECT, and if that doesn’t work I have to go to a long term treatment facility out of state. But I don’t know how I can survive waiting 3 weeks in my room. If these things actually would help me I might want to keep going but I don’t know if I can mange this for 3 more weeks. And because all the other things I’ve tried haven’t worked I don’t feel like these are super likely to work. Ive tried natural things as well such as working out and therapy none of those helped either. If I actually believed I would get better I would want to live, but the fact is it’s been this way so long and I’ve tried so many different things that didn’t work I’m starting to think nothing will. And if that’s the case and I’m truly gonna be miserable forever is it reasonable for me to take things into my own hands, it’s obviously not my first choice but I’ve tried so much and I’m suffering and I’m drained and I just want to rest and I feel like dying is the only way to do that. Anyone have any advice on how to get through this aside from going to a hospital or callling a hotline because if I call a hotline they will make me go to a hospital and I get really homesick and the hospital by where I live is not very good.",Dangerous-Extent-615,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12jxrsq/i_want_to_feel_better_but_i_feel_like_it/,ive dealing mental illness since wa 6 17 started depression diagnosis ive lot misdiagnosis stuff since current diagnosis high functioning autism major depressive disorder ocd generalized anxiety disorder add bpd mention feel important understand complex story think thing get better ive dealt self harm since wa 7 first suicide attempt wa wa 11 ive multiple since mostly overdoses ive involuntarily hospitalized 10 time 1 3 month facility non helped ive tried ton medicine one point wa misdiagnosed bipolar lithium got high dose 1800 milligram day see kidney doctor determined stage 3 kidney disease lithium toxicity longer bipolar diagnosis think wa actually bpd point ive tried many medicine help many different area area improved depression never ha ive even tried newer alternative medicine esketamine anxiety medicine help slightly nearly enough know else get anxious point feel like escape kill recently got kicked school thought wa much danger home room time isolated without anyone talk wa social circle go normal school went autism center high functioning spectrum handle regular school setting ive always issue self harm since got kicked school really bad lot child trauma family fortunately wa adopted good parent wa bullied lot wa public school 2nd grade dealt sa affect way think people day scared people know current plan made doctor family 3 week getting checked ect work go long term treatment facility state know survive waiting 3 week room thing actually would help might want keep going know mange 3 week thing tried worked feel like super likely work ive tried natural thing well working therapy none helped either actually believed would get better would want live fact way long tried many different thing work starting think nothing case truly gonna miserable forever reasonable take thing hand obviously first choice tried much suffering drained want rest feel like dying way anyone advice get aside going hospital callling hotline call hotline make go hospital get really homesick hospital live good,want feel better feel like impossible feel like give anyone advice keep hanging,dangerous extent 615

I'm almost at the brink,"I guess each and every one of us have had that ""time"". Maybe not even once or twice; but honestly, I feel like my conviction to die resounds more than ever these past few weeks. I've always struggle with mental illness. I always lied about it getting better; and honestly I thought I was getting better. However, by some strokes of the unforseen, I loved and got heart broken. I don't know if it's a silly ploy of fate, but the years of self-love and respect I've built just evaporated. It became a trigger for the mental illness I've repressed. I can't describe how I can deal with all the shit my mind have in store for me, but this--this stupid heart break, I can't deal. 

People have told me that ""it's just a guy"", or ""get over it and focus on yourself"". Basically the typical things your friends says on a drink out, but I just can't. It just won't dissipate. I don't know what to do anymore, I'm drowning in my own thoughts. The internal conflict within me burns me from the inside out. Honestly, I don't know why I'm writing this, nor do I know what I'm looking for anymore. Maybe a glimmer of hope that days will get better? Perhaps, but I don't await for the future anymore. I'm just sad, just broken, just struggling. The traumas he have gave tremendously resound till to this day. I don't know anymore.

Need some help. Somethings really bad going on with me.," 

Hi, I am just a normal guy and a student but I feel like I have symptoms of ADHD and extreme anxiety.

I cant stop shaking my legs, I cant stop thinking of other things while working on something else, I cant read properly texts mgs and I keep on reading it again and again, I cant stop thinking negative and feel good about myself and more. All of this are making me concerned as it is severely affecting my health and studies and everything. I have noticed many lifestyle changes in my body like not sleeping on time for eg- I sometimes sleep on 10pm but sometimes on 6 am and sometimes on 8pm and so on, Ive been thinking about negativity all the time and seeing downside of everything idk why and gory stuffs, I eat abnormally. I eat a lot of food and all junky food and even tho im full and not hungry i keep on eating it again and again and whenever I try to do something i cant stop shaking my leg and i feel very tired/sleepy. I dont feel motivated at all. And Im thinking on su\*cide for more than a month. I cant share all of this info to my parents as they will be more worried and I dont want them to be sad because of me. I dont want to take bad steps thats why im here trying to get help from you all. I told my mom about some of the things like shaking my leg all the time, ADHD symptoms and anxiety, she said we will visit to a psychiatrist but im too scared to go as i dont know what doctors will think of me and will say ""Big grown ass man cant even do basic things and will think what kind of help this 17 yo man needs"" idk Im really scared to visit a doctor as its not a normal thing to do so especially in India.

I am done with this thing and I need to fix this. I am genuinely concerned with this issue.

I searched a lot on google about all of this, some said taking sleeping pills will help, taking anti depressant will help and some said brain tonic will help you overcome this.

(pls suggest me pills or any medications which can help me out.)

I am really lost and I need help.

Can you all relate to this? or am i the only one who is like this? Pls tell me yall I just want to fix this its f\*cking my life badly, really bad.",hero2623F,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12jx2le/need_some_help_somethings_really_bad_going_on/,hi normal guy student feel like symptom adhd extreme anxiety cant stop shaking leg cant stop thinking thing working something else cant read properly text mg keep reading cant stop thinking negative feel good making concerned severely affecting health study everything noticed many lifestyle change body like sleeping time eg sometimes sleep 10pm sometimes 6 sometimes 8pm ive thinking negativity time seeing downside everything idk gory stuff eat abnormally eat lot food junky food even tho im full hungry keep eating whenever try something cant stop shaking leg feel tired sleepy dont feel motivated im thinking su cide month cant share info parent worried dont want sad dont want take bad step thats im trying get help told mom thing like shaking leg time adhd symptom anxiety said visit psychiatrist im scared go dont know doctor think say big grown man cant even basic thing think kind help 17 yo man need idk im really scared visit doctor normal thing especially india done thing need fix genuinely concerned issue searched lot google said taking sleeping pill help taking anti depressant help said brain tonic help overcome pls suggest pill medication help really lost need help relate one like pls tell yall want fix f cking life badly really bad,need help somethings really bad going,hero 2623 f

A friend repeatedly tells me they're going to kill themselves,"Okay, so I've been friends with this person a lot of time and we're very close.

They're right now going through a toxic relationship on which they're being abused and they're suffering a lot. I try to constantly help them and give them as much support as I can daily.

The thing is that from time to time they randomly send me messages like ""I am going to kill myself. Goodbye"" or ""I'm going to suicide as soon as I get home. Bye"" and every time they say that I'm about to have a fucking heart attack. (This has been happening for years already, even before they started that relationship, it's just getting more common now.)

The thing is that they randomly say that, I try to ask them if they are okay and try to give them support as fast I can and then they just say stuff like, yeah i'm going through the same thing as always. And then go start a normal convo as if nothing has happened.

I think I have pretty good mental health myself, so I think I can handle it well. But sometimes they're literally one day going I'm going to kill myself, and the next day they send me a photo of them hanging out with the person they're having a toxic relationship super happy as if nothing had happened the day before, while I'm feeling down because of the suicidal messages.

I don't want to call them out on this right now because I know they're feeling depressed and they are probably thinking about killing themselves, and calling them out will make them feel bad for sure, but every time I'm like hanging out with people and I get one of those ""I'm going to end my life, goodbye"" I swear my heart is going to explode.

People have been telling me that i seem happier than before and that makes me extremely guilty because every time when i see someone who is close to me the first thing i think of is '' Is this the last time i see them? ''.

I just can't take this anymore, i don't know what to do with these thoughts that i'm drowning in.

Hi,"I want to get this out of me cuz I don't have many friends that know me the way I am and I would love someone that I could console with. I'm 28, never been in a relationship, lonely af, desperate for real friends and love, haven't had a job yet cuz I only recently completed my college education (UG and PG).. first college I went to was traumatic and I had to run away (didn't know the local language and ended up being taking advantage of). I cannot be open with my parents cuz they're narrow minded, supercatholic, and conservate as heck. I am distressed by the way I look (terrible proportions, knock-kneed) and it's probably why I can't find a significant other. Parents had been forcing me to be a priest as a kid and that has really fucked with my aspirations (I've wanted to be a pilot, racer, tour/travel guide).  I have 2 sisters, eldest is 15 years older than me so she's kinda like a stranger to me. My second sis really only cared about herself and made me lie so she could hang with her friends. So I genuinely feel alone. I've always thought about suicide and wanted to attempt to do it too, but even attempting it has been such difficulty.

Venting,"I'm extroverted. Have been my whole life. Also, have always had some form of suicidal ideation my whole life. My earliest memory is watching a commercial and finding out suicidal ideation isn't normal. 

Currently, I am finding myself having massive anxiety messaging any friend back. I haven't messaged a friend back in weeks but I'm also upset with myself for not messaging them back, but every day I don't it's harder to respond. 

I go through a moment of feeling good, and then I remember that I didn't message someone, or that I forgot something and then I'm thrown into a spiral of thoughts of just running away from everything. Thinking how it would be easier to just not exist. 

I just recently got into a fight with my mom and she said I don't come down anymore and that I spend more time with my inlaws then them. It's kinda true, but that's because they always invite us out for things and so we see them like 1 or 2 times a month, which is more than I see my family, but I call my mom everyday. I joked about how I've cut everyone off in my life and then she made it a point of how she should just never share her feelings and all this shit. So now I literally have only been talking to my partner because we live together.

Seeking help for a friend,"My friend today recently gave me a vibe that hit a lot differently that his past mentions of his problems.

Today felt more of an actual cry for help.

He normally keeps to himself and doesn’t ever talk about his problems to this degree.

He would make backhanded jokes about his depression and make light of it and I would still take it with some concern. Usually came off as a “I feel this way but I’m okay”, but today was different. He NEVER expresses himself the way he did about it. He’s been going to therapy and getting help. But for a few months he’s been in this neutral type default mode where he’s as emotional as a robot. He would brush off any mention of being asked if he was okay like everything is fine, but today, being in that same “default” mood, he openly said he feels more inclined to commit suicide and get it over with.

There are a lot of things we talked about before regarding his depression, so I know a lot of what he’s dealing with but I still don’t have the full picture.

I want to help but there’s so much I can do. I asked him to include me in his psych therapy on his next visit so I can listen to what’s going on and help by giving the therapist more to go off of from a friends perspective. 

Im asking for any advice or something I can do to keep him at ease.

My oldest brother did the same thing years ago and he went through with it and I was too young and naive to be of any help. I don’t want to go through with that with my best friend.",autismo-nismo,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12jvsbt/seeking_help_for_a_friend/,friend today recently gave vibe hit lot differently past mention problem today felt actual cry help normally keep ever talk problem degree would make backhanded joke depression make light would still take concern usually came feel way okay today wa different never express way going therapy getting help month neutral type default mode emotional robot would brush mention asked wa okay like everything fine today default mood openly said feel inclined commit suicide get lot thing talked regarding depression know lot dealing still full picture want help much asked include psych therapy next visit listen going help giving therapist go friend perspective im asking advice something keep ease oldest brother thing year ago went wa young naive help want go best friend,seeking help friend,autism nismo

Plan in motion but I don’t want to die …,"I have a plan. It’s in motion. No one in my life will know I have died for a while. Thankfully the way my life is most people won’t figure it out for a good month or two. Enough for them to get over seeing me and being around me so it will be easier for them. After that it’s just a question of going to the cliff and jumping really. Or Xanax/heroine. 

I don’t really want to die though. It’s sad. I really don’t want to. But I was never meant to be born so im not made for this life. It’s been 27years of me trying and hoping for it to get better, and it did sometimes… but then it went right back to how it was and even worse. Did therapy, did the working out, did the routine, did the friends but you know… some people are just mistakes and weren’t made to be here, it’s okay. I wish I was, I really like being alive and what life has to offer. I wish I could do it like everyone else seems able to. I don’t know this is long…. I hope most of you get the help you want you deserve it! ❤️

therapist told me i’m just going through normal “young adult” stuff,"I didn’t go into much detail because I was uncomfortable but the therapist told me what I’m experiencing is considered completely normal. Apparently everyone feels like that because their frontal lobe is forming or something. I feel so invalid and regret ever reaching out for help. I absolutely did not expect anything but hearing that all i’m struggling with is not that serious just made me embarrassed. It was a sort of a confirmation I needed to finally make the decision to end it. It won’t get any better, I tried therapy like I was told to do and it just made things worse.  I don’t have any more hope or motivation left so I guess that’s it.

God I'm so tired. Of repeating myself in these posts. And of thinking the same way without being able to express it to the people around me.,"Once again... I'm here. Thought I'd have killed myself long ago, but somehow or other. I'm tired. That's all I feel. I just want the mercy of death, yet people love me. 

I know I shouldn't take it for granted. I know there are some of you wishing for what I had. However, I'm so fucked up. I tell my friends and family I don't know what I want in the future bc I know it's gonna end in suicide.

What's the point of living when I feel so empty. I'm just so tired of living a lie. My friends and family don't know me. They know a lie or how a human is supposed to act. 

I told my mom and now I'm on antidepressants but I still feel the same. She cries over how I feel and it makes me cry even more. The only person I really cared about is suffering bc of me and it only makes me feel worse. I hate myself in every way. I can't stop crying. Is this my punishment for feeling the way I do?

I just want to kill myself but I don't want to make them sad. I'm so tired. I can't live up to anyone's expectations. I'm so useless. I can't even pretend most of the time now. I'm scared to tell people about how I really feel because I don't want ro get locked up. I know my mind warrants it but I'm scared of losing the little freedom I have.

I don't know what to do. I know I'll kill myself. I know it'll happen. I've been resisting temptations for them but I'm so tired. I've begun thinking darker thoughts, such as ""why do I have to live for them, especially when they're so happy? I'm the only one suffering, being the emotional punching bag that I am so I can be the best self for them, all while I waste away internally.

I know they've done nothing wrong, it's me who's wrong. They don't deserve the sadness that'll come with my demise. But I'm so tired of living for them. My soul is beaten and battered. I've written time and time again about this, whether it's in a post akin to this or just in my personal journal. I don't know how much more I can take. I don't want to tell them bc I'm afraid of being judged. 

I'm so scared of everything. I'm so useless. I'm so tired. I'm so sad. I don't know how to feel. I don't understand my emotions. I don't want to.

Too much has gone wrong,"I’m miserable. For starters I was born the most genetic unfortunate person. I have a heart condition. At first it isn’t a big deal but the limitations are very hard too deal with. I didn’t get to play sports growing up like I wanted to, I was too scared to drink or smoke, and most of all just not being allowed to do things because of a condition I didn’t ask to be born with has creating the most unhinged self talk ever. Fast forward 6 years and now my hairline isn’t the best and I wanted to fix it but can’t take medicine for it because of my heart condition. I’ve read that it’s unsafe to get a tattoo because of my heart condition. I’m not tall, I have a stupid heart condition, and my hair is falling out and making me look much older. Alot of people talk about self improvement and I watch those videos all the time but the issue is because my disease makes lifting weight impossible and my hair line is shit, I’m stuck as skinny 5 head freak. I did some push-ups recently and the amount of chest pain it caused after was unbearable. Right now I work at a restaurant and we have to wear hats and sometimes I feel like girls are into me but little do they know that under the hat I got a five head. I had a therapist for my condition but they said they couldn’t really help me much with my self esteem because their experience was in acceptance of my disease and less about my esteem. They asked if I was suicidal like at the end of ever session and I normally lie but this time I told her the truth expect still didn’t tell her my plan because I knew she’d throw me in the looney bin. I took anti depressants for a bit but they felt like they made me more suicidal although I didn’t take them long enough for them to be effective. My therapist wanted me to get evaluated and referred me to other therapists but I don’t want to continue wasting my parents time and money on my stupid problem when suicide is clearly the best option. The problem is that I’m the rational one. Killing myself because I am a genetic freak is more than acceptable. I am a 24 year old virgin who lives at my parents and have no degree or skills. I don’t have any fucking money and I will probably die a horrible death anyways from my disease. The only problem I’m having is trying to figure out when and how to do it. I want to go somewhere far away from my family so they don’t have to see me but at the same time I don’t want anyone to steal my car and put my parents worse off than before.",Subject-Army6752,4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12jfc84/too_much_has_gone_wrong/,miserable starter wa born genetic unfortunate person heart condition first big deal limitation hard deal get play sport growing like wanted wa scared drink smoke allowed thing condition ask born ha creating unhinged self talk ever fast forward 6 year hairline best wanted fix take medicine heart condition read unsafe get tattoo heart condition tall stupid heart condition hair falling making look much older alot people talk self improvement watch video time issue disease make lifting weight impossible hair line shit stuck skinny 5 head freak push ups recently amount chest pain caused wa unbearable right work restaurant wear hat sometimes feel like girl little know hat got five head therapist condition said really help much self esteem experience wa acceptance disease le esteem asked wa suicidal like end ever session normally lie time told truth expect still tell plan knew throw looney bin took anti depressant bit felt like made suicidal although take long enough effective therapist wanted get evaluated referred therapist want continue wasting parent time money stupid problem suicide clearly best option problem rational one killing genetic freak acceptable 24 year old virgin life parent degree skill fucking money probably die horrible death anyways disease problem trying figure want go somewhere far away family see time want anyone steal car put parent worse,much ha gone wrong,subject army 6752
Everything just keeps getting worse,"Where can I possibly begin? I've suffered with mental health issues my entire life. I was bullied mercilessly as a child and teenager, which has probably given me undiagnosed PTSD, and I first wanted to kill myself when I was 10 years old. I've had tonnes of diagnoses, but nothing changes it. 

I'm on antidepressants, and they numb it slightly, but this year is breaking me.

It's my first year of university. I was doing better than I ever had in my life, when it all came crumbling down. It started with a girl I was seeing. I was in love with her, my every thought was about her, I genuinely wanted to marry her and spend the rest of my life with her. Then, one day I had a nightmare about discovering online that she had another boyfriend the entire time, and within the dream, my response was to self harm and take my life. Later that very same day... I discovered that she did indeed have another boyfriend, and she'd been playing with me the entire time. Before people start judging me, it wasn't wishful thinking, we'd been on a date, we spoke constantly, we exchanged messages on Valentine's, and she had every opportunity to tell me she was seeing someone else, if she had wanted to.

As you can imagine, my response was not pretty. I suffered a nervous breakdown and slashed my wrists. In the end, my flatmates cleaned me up and called for someone to take me to the hospital. They were beyond useless, they didn't offer me any support, they just put iodine on my wounds then discharged me after 15 minutes. I nearly ended it right there. The hospital entrance opens onto a main road, and I just wanted to step out into the traffic.

From there, things with my flatmates got tense. I've been around mental health issues my entire life, so I don't realise how distressing it is for people to see others in that position. But even so, my flat just treated me different. In the end, we had a meeting, where they revealed it wasn't just that night, but other things which I can't reveal for anonymity's sake. What they said was reasonable, and that should have been the end of it, but it wasn't.

The thing that has finally broken me is discovering that a large portion of the flat and our mutual friends were taking a holiday to the Mediterranean, which they attempted to conceal from me and the others who weren't invited, but failed at that. It's made me feel like a reject, an unwanted hanger-on who does nothing but detract from the lives of others. I've never had friends, even when I was a child, but I adored my flat, even those I've had disagreements with. I don't know why I was excluded, whether I'd just missed the conversation or if there was a genuine reason for it, but it doesn't change how utterly heartbroken I am.

And then, to top it all off, a few days ago someone attempted to blackmail me over the internet, which is currently being dealt with by the police, although it's doubtful anyone will ever be caught.

I don't think I ever would kill myself, I'm too afraid of death to ever go through with it, but every single day, the thought crosses my mind. Sometimes, I genuinely think I make everyone else's lives worse. I actively detract from the happiness in the room.

A friend told me he tried to commit suicide.,"Hi,
Sorry for the bad English.

I have known this guy for 3/4 months, so it surely is not enough time to completely know someone.

Today we were at school, in front of our computers. We were talking, as usual, and joking about random things. We both enjoy dark humor, so we don't really have a problem with ""offensive"" jokes.
I don't even remember how we arrived there, but after joking about something, he said something like ""I actually tried to kill myself like that"" or something. At the beginning I thought he was joking. After all, we both enjoy black humor. But then, he showed me his wrists and there were cuts. They didn't seem recent, and at the same time didn't seem too old.
He said that his parents knew about it and that they are worried. I have reasons to believe that he already goes to therapy.

I loved her, and she loved me. It was such an intensely bright spot in my life that it's hard to see anything else now, and I've felt the exact same way every day since we parted. We chat a little bit, now and then on Snap or Insta, and every time I feel that exact same feeling of just complete, depthless love for her. I've never felt this way about anyone, not even ""the same feeling but less,"" not even my wife if I'm honest, and it's just so intense and different. Somedays it's so bad, I can't work or sleep. I woke up this morning crying because my first thought was of her, and then I have to lie to my wife about what's wrong.

Every day just feels like one more day wasted without her, and I do nothing but waste days. I'm sure she barely thinks about me, but she was so wonderful, caring, supportive. I felt like I could do anything with her; however, the converse is that I feel like I can't do anything without her.

How do you deal with the thoughts of Suicide or the afterthoughts and effects?,"I was planning to do the unthinkable I think or I was at least entertaining the thought. I wanted to die the night my girlfriend said we needed space to work on our relationship. I'm wanted to do it maybe I don't know she wouldn't leave me alone long enough. She said she's still my best friend but she no longer has romantic feelings for me. She wants to separate for a few months to a year to work on our selves and get back together. I have been abandoned before I'm so afraid it will happen again.

I'm also a Trans woman in a conservative aera that is not too fond of people like me. I only get through the day because of her. I don't know what I would do without her I'm so scared. I have thoughts sometimes that I should just do it. I want to be positive but these intrusive thoughts keep creeping in. In my head I know she's telling the truth by my heart says that people just lie and hurt you. She is still here for two months but she is leaving for a bit after that. 

My heart just tells me that I'm a terrible person and that I should just do it. I don't think I'm capable of that but they won't go away no matter how hard I try. She doesn't use reddit much so I have been using it to write out my feelings. They are a mess I know but it somewhat helps. It's the fact that I can't get these thoughts out of my head that bothers me. I did try once before but thankfully I was unsuccessful when I was younger. My family has a history of depression.

Cry for help,"Dear everyone!

This is my official cry for help. First of all, my intention is not to ask you all for help. The title is kind of ironic. In the last 6 months my life turned upside down. Everything was decent before (not really good, but definitely not bad). Then it took a dark turn, I don't really want to go into full detail but lets just say I got into a bad spending habbit and flew through my money, eventually taking a overdraft on my card and you can guess it. Once I received my pay, I spent it again not even clearing my overdraft. Well, I enjoyed my life less and less to a point where I got depression and suicidal thoughts. 

Also quick: I already had suicidal thoughts a couple years prior because I have a health problem which requires a lot of money which I cannot afford. But I've now lived with this health problem for over 7 years and sort of accepted it. Even thought my life is shit with just the health problem itself.

My spending habbit got really bad in November and onwards from there. I think I now got it somewhat under control but my life is still shit. Every day I wake up, and It's hell all over again. I don't want to live like this. This probably sounds selfish but I really don't think I deserve this life. Looking back to school every single one had a better life than me, and I think I'm a far better person than quite a lot of them but it is what it is, I was born and I cannot undo that.

Every day I look at stories from other people on this reddit and it breaks my heart and I get quite emotional because I can relate sooo much to a lot of them. I just wanted to see if someone that's down like me wants to get friends and stay in contact for long term so we can push through. I feel like we're stronger together. I've never had a real suicide attempt but I've definitely considered it to jump from a high building or jump in front of a train because I have no access to guns and pills.

I really don't know anymore, I'm at a point where I honestly dont see myself living longer for more than 1-2 years. My plan is to get money and SAVE IT to enjoy a bit of it with my family and then maybe order something from the dark web and leave earth. I don't think that I'm destined to be on earth until the age of 25 or older. Unless something drastically changes but even then, the last 6 months have been pure hell for me and I don't even wish that to happen to my worst enemy. I literally went to work every day, got home, then spent the money and looked like a real idiot.

I'm just asking all of you that are suicidal to don't do it and really just talk to a loved one. It might not be your parents etc. I don't know I don't even want to sound like someone that knows what he's talking about because I don't. I just feel like I'm slowly loosing the fight. I tried fighting for 6 months but it didn't work out.

Also, I never really wanted to post something in here, but here I am posting it for a reason. Because I hit a new rock bottom. I have no finances until 3 weeks from now. It sucks. I cant even buy food but I guess I gotta fight through the dumb position I put myself in.

That's been it from me. Hopefully you all can find some joy that I couldn't find.

im mentally torturing myself and its driving me to the edge," 

I'm 19 M. my life has been really messed up lately. I don't want to self-diagnose but something is very wrong with me and i don't know how to label it without being disrespectful to ppl who struggle with actual diagnosed mental illnesses.

anyways. for the past 6 months I've been going thru repeatedly traumatic events. last month i distanced myself from my friends over discord who mostly are at least 3 years younger than me. i didn't ghost them Tho I let them know ill be away for a while. I had noticed my decaying mental health and decided that as the older friend I'm responsible to prevent my younger friends, whom I love like my little siblings from being (unintentionally) hurt by me who isn't the most mentally stable at the moment.

i can't reach out to my irl friends abt these stuff even tho i trust and love them. My online best friend is also going thru his own tough time and i don't wanna burden him with my problems for now.

so in this solitude i have resorted to true crime and horror YouTube videos for ""comfort"". even before the events of past 6 months I've always had interest in these types of videos but back then it was a very healthier interest and i watched them as a form of education.

lately i torment myself with them. willingly watching the specific topics that are connected to my trauma that will trigger me. especially the topic of SA. constantly telling myself how my trauma is nothing compared to these and how much of a p\*ssy I am, degrading myself until I'm nauseous. maybe it's a form of S//H because i don't have the balls to do it to myself physically. I don't know, I'm in constant agony and i can't bring myself to stop. i also suffer from intrusive thoughts and they keep getting more graphic and disturbing. i keep having suicidal thoughts it hurts so much

How do you know when it’s time?,"Well obviously those who can best answer this aren’t around anymore to do so. 
I don’t particularly want to die, just find living increasingly unbearable, and I have a pretty high threshold for that, as I’ve been battling depression for almost 3 decades. But at what point does it become obvious that I’m just needlessly prolonging things, there should really be a checklist of areas to first cover. My only connection is a minuscule, irrational hope that I missed something, though I don’t believe that to be true. 

I’ve been on dozens of different meds, properly taken, from all antidepressant subcategories, except  maoi, as well as countless associated meds. 
Years of therapy, including neurofeedback and emdr. 
Inpatient at psych ward half a dozen times…though it was pretty pointless. 
TMS, ECT, exercise, better diet. 
I should have started ketamine infusion treatments weeks ago, but still waiting for a simple form to be returned from my inept psychiatrist’s office. Though from what I’ve heard, it helps for a few weeks, then depression finds its way back in, so not really missing much, but I wouldn’t mind feeling alive for even those few weeks.

I feel like theres more, but I’m drawing a blank. 

Am I missing anything? 

I just can’t believe how abysmal mental health services are in the US. I’ve never once, in all those years, felt like I was in competent hands. Most everything I’ve tried was the result of self-research, have never received any kind of direction from any of the dr’s I’ve seen. But I’m far from an expert, and that research is kind of challenging when in constant state of depression, plus a self view of worthlessness, so hard to put much stake in something if it was my idea to begin with. 

I’m not scared of dying. Had a failed attempt a year ago, and those few seconds before losing consciousness were the most at peace and content I’d felt in ages, really wish the belt hadn’t ripped so that I wouldn’t feel the need to continue asking these questions. But figured might as well ask first, as I’ve factored in the errors from last time, there will be no risk of anything going wrong the next time. It’s likely that certainty that’s caused me to feel the need to ensure there’s nothing I’ve missed.",Standard-Holiday-486,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12jgrjj/how_do_you_know_when_its_time/,well obviously best answer around anymore particularly want die find living increasingly unbearable pretty high threshold battling depression almost 3 decade point doe become obvious needlessly prolonging thing really checklist area first cover connection minuscule irrational hope missed something though believe true dozen different med properly taken antidepressant subcategories except maoi well countless associated med year therapy including neurofeedback emdr inpatient psych ward half dozen time though wa pretty pointless tm ect exercise better diet started ketamine infusion treatment week ago still waiting simple form returned inept psychiatrist office though heard help week depression find way back really missing much mind feeling alive even week feel like drawing blank missing anything believe abysmal mental health service u never year felt like wa competent hand everything tried wa result self research never received kind direction dr seen far expert research kind challenging constant state depression plus self view worthlessness hard put much stake something wa idea begin scared dying failed attempt year ago second losing consciousness peace content felt age really wish belt ripped feel need continue asking question figured might well ask first factored error last time risk anything going wrong next time likely certainty caused feel need ensure nothing missed,know time,standard holiday 486

I was anxious in the moment about dying but I didn’t regret it. I’m trying again tonight. I’m going to do it. 


This is the only way I won’t feel trapped anymore. This is the only way I won’t hurt anyone just by existing around them. 


I’m going to write a note saying my best friend will take care of my cat (he deserves better than me) and that’s all I’m writing. Fuck it. No one deserves to know why but me. Figure it out. 



If you’re here because I made a funny comment and you want to stalk my profile, sorry I don’t have a better explanation for you. If you’re here because you see I post a lot about Bright Eyes and want to make sure I’m not sure I’m not stalking them, I’m not, and please don’t spam them telling them a fan killed themself like Fall Out Boy fans did in the Ye Olde Tumblr days, it’s weird.

I think I found the source of (some of) my suicidal ideation,"I realized something today and I feel like I have to write it down or the thought of it will disappear. 

As I went shopping with a friend, I asked her for her opinion on something and she made a comment about my appearance that triggered me. I was surprised at how upset it made me and then I realized a fact that had been staring me in the face for years now. 
I let her walk all over me.

I think I have felt this for a while and to be honest I don't even think it's ill intended but it is an unchangeable fact of our relationship.

I realized that I've been allowing people to demean and belittle me my whole life. In fact, I seem to draw out this type of person. Again and again, friend after friend, someone comes along and becomes an instant ""best friend"" of mine seeing that my interests are their own, my dislikes are theirs too and where I am quiet -they are outspoken. Where I am indecisive, they take charge. 

What they don't know is that it is all a lie. I have been (somewhat unknowingly) mirroring them and delivering to them the version of themselves they most like. I mimic their sayings and gestures and make myself small so they can feel big. I allow them to speak for me so they feel needed and important. I allow them to pick on me so they feel better and I allow them to win so they don't feel threatened. Every. Time.

Why? Because I have no interest in being the winner. In being heard, or seen. I have no interest in life. I learned so young to make other people happy above anything else. That no amount of happiness I felt for myself could compare to how it felt to make someone else happy.

Up until now, I have just gone through a cycle of allowing these people to step on me until I no longer feel anything for them and then there is no joy in seeing them happy. When you give them permission, you really see how far people will go to use you. But eventually they will disgust you for this very same reason.

That's when I cut them out. I quickly flip the switch off that I flipped on. I stop lying to myself about how much I love and need them and I go back to feeling absolutely nothing at all.

I don't complain about it because I am a people pleaser and I've learned to put myself last, but that's the thing. It's not me putting myself last. It's the version of me I created to please others. I think there has always been a version of myself trapped inside who CANNOT STAND being belittled. And she gets out sometimes.

Lately, she's been out a lot and she's the part of me that I've been labeling emotionally unstable, but what if she is me? Like the REAL me? What if the version of myself I curated to be a doormat is the version of myself I've been wanting to kill. 

Doesn't it seem reasonable that a person trapped inside their own body would want so badly to be in control they would want to kill the idiot in the driver's seat?

I think it's possible that I don't want to die at all. I just want to live in control of my own body.",Stained_Sweater,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12jbhl7/i_think_i_found_the_source_of_some_of_my_suicidal/,realized something today feel like write thought disappear went shopping friend asked opinion something made comment appearance triggered wa surprised upset made realized fact staring face year let walk think felt honest even think ill intended unchangeable fact relationship realized allowing people demean belittle whole life fact seem draw type person friend friend someone come along becomes instant best friend mine seeing interest dislike quiet outspoken indecisive take charge know lie somewhat unknowingly mirroring delivering version like mimic saying gesture make small feel big allow speak feel needed important allow pick feel better allow win feel threatened every time interest winner heard seen interest life learned young make people happy anything else amount happiness felt could compare felt make someone else happy gone cycle allowing people step longer feel anything joy seeing happy give permission really see far people go use eventually disgust reason cut quickly flip switch flipped stop lying much love need go back feeling absolutely nothing complain people pleaser learned put last thing putting last version created please others think ha always version trapped inside cannot stand belittled get sometimes lately lot part labeling emotionally unstable like real version curated doormat version wanting kill seem reasonable person trapped inside body would want badly control would want kill idiot driver seat think possible want die want live control body,think found source suicidal ideation,stained sweater

"I don't want to die, but I do want to be dead.","That's the best way I can put it. Suicides been a theme in my family so I'm intimately aware with what it does to those close to us. I could never, and I hope I never, do that to my family. I love them too much and they deserve better. So much better than anything I could ever possibly hope to give.

But fuck, I wish they didn't love me, and I didn't love them. I wish I could disconnect from it all and just die, and end. I don't like being here in this brain because I know it will never change, it won't get better. It's not that easy, it's never been that easy.

I'm stuck running a race I don't want to win, I don't even want to finish the fucking thing. I just want it to stop. 

I owe it to everyone around me to keep a smile nailed to my face no matter how much it hurts. I hurt enough already, what's a little more added anxiety when that's all I've ever known?

I need someone to listen,"I feel like I can't do this anymore. Every single day I am bombarded with intrusive thoughts. I am demolished by reminders of bad things that happened to me. I just feel so helpless. My medication only helps me to not cry. There's two reasons why I won't commit. My cousin who I love so dearly and who is my absolute best friend in the whole world, and my enormous fear of death. 
I feel so helpless most days and I feel like I'm never going to get better. Middle school was when I got my first suicidal thought. But the depression was much much earlier. It started from the bullying I've got since elementary school.

The thing is, now, I'm not being bullied. I'm not being abused any more. I have a loving family and a best friend and a job, so ideally I shouldn't be suicidal. Fuck dude, I'm even lucky enough to have a therapist. I don't know. While I'm not going to/don't have any serious plans to commit, I really really do think about it. A lot. 

As an autistic person, one of my special interests is A Silent Voice. I can't go one single day without thinking about that movie, and how heavily I relate to Shouko Nishimiya. I can't even put it into words, spoilers for the movie ahead if you don't know, she attempts suicide, and you know what she says to Shoya when he wakes up from a coma after falling off the building instead of her after trying to save her? She says that it's her fault that he fell, because she was selfish and couldn't change. ""No you're wrong! It's because I couldn't change, and that's why you fell! I'm so selfish!"" I cry so hard every time that scene comes on. I feel that I would react that exact way in that situation. I don't know. I feel I'm getting off topic. But anyways... just a thought dump I guess. I don't know.

I just want to tell someone,"How much it hurts. How tired I am. I can’t talk to anyone in my real life about it. I’ve felt like this for years now and expressing my pain only caused my relationship with my family to break down. We’re finally on good terms, but I am so alone. I keep it all inside. 

I was finally recovering, finally hopeful for a good thing when I found a relationship. It felt so good to be wanted. And then I was hurt and betrayed over and over again until it ended in the most traumatic way. My world changed when I found out he lied about everything. I don’t even know who he was. Or who I am. I was manipulated so hard that I still wish I could have him back even after everything. I just wanted to be loved. I can’t trust myself to be a good judge of character. The world feels so cold and evil and I don’t know why my kindness was repaid with more pain. Now I am more alone than ever before. My good thing was too good to be true.

It ended a month ago, and I was doing well for a while. But i am so unstable, one minute I feel euphoric and like an awesome person and everything is fast and exciting and life is endless possibility. Then out of nowhere I lose it and I can’t stop thinking of suicide. I sob and i tell myself I can’t do that to my family but I know I need to because I can’t go on. In both states I hurt myself and abuse substances and I gradually feel I lose more and more of myself to the darkness. I feel like two people. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. My mood can switch like that multiple times a day and i don’t know how to stop. 

I can’t afford therapy and my doctor has kept me on the same medication for years. It isn’t helping. I just want someone, even the Internet void to know how hard I have tried. I really have pushed through every single day since I was about 14. Now I’m 20. When will it be enough. I’m afraid that one day I’ll just lose it during one of the bad episodes and do it finally. It would probably be a much easier path than life for me, but I never want to disrupt the lives of those I love like that. I know the damage it does. I have tried before and it destroyed everything I had.

I am so exhausted. If I ever do it, I want to see him one last time before I die. He may have been the most painful thing that ever happened to me, but I just want to be held one more time. Even if it’s a lie. I hate him, but most of all I hate myself for my weakness. 

It takes everything I have to work my minimum wage job and keep myself from doing crazy shit. Other people are out there living. I feel like a failure and god I am so sorry. I am privileged and many would kill for what I have. I am so sorry for wasting my years in needless suffering.

I truly don’t know how I’ll make it out alive,"It feels like everything that could go wrong has gone wrong. Every attempt I make to better my situation goes awry. 

I try to move out of my toxic home environment, the rental and property market becomes unattainable. At this point I’ll be living at home till 35 no joke. I try to better my health, dental and physical problems suddenly take hold. I’ve been living with constant dental pain for 7 months that no one can fix or diagnose. I’m pretty sure I have endometriosis on top of other things. Due to childhood abuse/neglect, I have a total lack of emotion, not even towards the people I’m supposed to love the most which is an awful way to live. I can’t even feel love for my own mother even though it’s probably much of her fault. I’m battling so many mental illnesses I don’t know where one ends and the other begins. I have no partner to move in with and make things easier financially or otherwise. Ive always been raised in such a way that I’ve only ever been able to rely on myself. Even as I child I was always told to figure things out myself, yet suddenly I’m expected to be a loving caring daughter now that my mum is sick. I wish I could feel that way towards her because I truly wish nothing but good health for her who’s been through so much in life already. But it simply wasn’t the way I was brought up. Plus I think I secretly resent her for bringing me into this shitty life to suffer with her. Oh also my hair is falling out in clumps and I’ll be bald by the end of the year at this rate. 

I took a mental health day from work today and am seriously wondering how I’m going to go back tomorrow and do this for the next God knows however many more years. If I have a mortgage as a single person I’ll literally have to work for at least as long as I can pay it off. What hopes do I have left, what dreams?

I wanted to be an author but the constant dental pain makes it impossible to think clearly.

And then I feel selfish again because I’m sure others in the world have it worse.

This is a new level of suicidality even for me. I’m just afraid of going to a worse fate in hell. But I just can’t see what other option I have. They say God knows how much you can take...busing this too much? Why push me to suicide? And if everything is predetermined anyway then wasn’t this always the way it was going to end? Like Judas, or Job.

I always kept hope as a child that in adulthood there would be good things waiting for me. That I had suffered all I would early on and the world isn’t so cruel as to make me suffer more.

What I want to leave behind,"I don't expect anyone to read it, let alone comment. I don't have a set date yet, just plans, but for now I prefer to write such a letter in advance. I just want to vent and use this post as my last letter. Maybe after my death, someone will want to know why I made such a decision. Or the police may be looking for evidence to make sure it was a suicide and not a homicide. So here's the proof. Unfortunately, finding it will take a little more effort than finding a piece of paper next to the body, but I'm not going to log out of my account, so whoever wants it will find it.

I don't really know where to start, so it's probably best to start at the beginning. I'm 23F and all I really wanted in my life was an emotional connection with another human being. I always wanted someone who would understand me, with whom I could talk about anything and not even in a romantic context, I just needed someone I could call a soul mate, even platonic.

However, here I am as an adult and I've decided that I'm finally giving up and I don't have the strength to fight anymore.

I don't remember most of my childhood, my father was emotionally unavailable and my mother most likely has a narcissistic personality disorder, so it always had to revolve around her. As long as my grandmother was alive, she took care of me. After her death, I spent most of my time at school or with my aunt who did not work, because my parents did not have time to take care of me.  When I was a child, I dreamed that something terrible would happen to me, that I would be on the brink of death, because I believed that maybe then someone would finally pay attention only to me.

However, the mental and physical abuse used by my parents made me think  that a different relationship than one in which I sacrifice myself for the other person, regardless of how that person treats me, does not exist. That's why I've always been drawn to wounded people, I wanted to take care of them and thanks to this, I could also heal this little me who still lived inside me.

Throughout my life I have had many friends, of course, in the background there was a difficult relationship with my parents, which often led me to the brink of suicide. Yet I kept trying to find that escape elsewhere. But I always ended up alone and hurt. For many years I tried to convince myself that my mother's words are untrue, that despite what she says, I am a valuable and good person, that despite my appearance and behavior, someone will want to be with me. But life keeps proving to me that I was wrong, that I'm just a monstrosity whose existence makes no sense. 

I don't want to put all the blame on others because looking back I know that I was garbage at times or acted like an idiot. But I want to let it out, just this one and last time.

I was tormented already in kindergarten, two images in particular were etched in my mind. Girl my age who abused me daily by pulling my hair, pulling my hairpins, and stealing them. The second such person was an older boy who beat me and chased me into a corner until I curled up and covered myself with my hands from his blows. Then he called me names and spit on me. I couldn't defend myself, and the teachers ignored it. As a result, I refused to eat, which resulted in blackmailing me by my carers and parents that they were spending money on food for me, and I did not respect that by not wanting to eat.

Bullying from other children ended when I found my first friend. It was Jay, we had met in kindergarten and became inseparable mainly because neither of us was liked by the other children. I was completely unable to make friends (which I still can't do today), and he was ridiculed because he preferred to play with dolls with girls, rather than with cars like other boys. I also tried to make friends with other children, but they did not want to.

Soon after, a new girl named Sharon joined our class. She came from abroad, so she didn't speak my native language very well, so other children didn't want to be friends with her. Except me. We quickly became friends and that's how our group was formed. Me and Jay and Sharon who only got along with each other and stood out from the rest.

When I was 9 years old, girl named Natasha also joined our group. Since then, there have been times when Nat and Sharon have pushed me aside and spent more time together, and I've grown closer to Jay. I opened up to him about some of my secrets, but he started threatening to tell others everything I told him, which absolutely terrified me. He never did, but for a long time I lived every day in absolute terror that everyone would find out things about me that I preferred to keep to myself. Of course, looking back, if these ""secrets"" came to light, nothing would have happened because they were completely normal things.

Years passed, Natasha found another friend, that's why she left our group, Jay also slowly began to move around in other company, while Sharon stayed with me, but she became very manipulative and I became a source of some emotional release for her. We also got to the age where we started to like boys. I was often too shy to make the first move, so I went unnoticed. Sharon, under the pretext of giving me advice, found out who my love interest was, and then did everything to make him pay attention to her. It usually ended up in a way that when the boy completely ignored me and focused on Sharon, she would lose interest and leave the boy. In the meantime, she also liked to invent various ailments and dramas, leading me to panic attacks more than once, caused by the fact that I was very worried about her.

During this time Jay started hanging out with girls who made fun of me a lot and sometimes Sharon too, I think he made fun of me too, but I didn't know it at the time. One day I complained to him how much I disliked these girls, which he told them right away which only made my life more difficult.

Some time later, as a result of an incident (too complicated to decribe it), I found out that Sharon and Jay were given the choice of spending time with me and receiving a few dollars, or spending time by themselves and receiving several dollars. They chose money. I think that was one of the events that broke my heart more because I just wanted friendship.  
 Some time later a boy named Charles also joined our group. I liked him, but of course he quickly became Sharon's boyfriend. I was still friends with them, but I felt completely unnecessary, which they did not hide. Finally, it was time for us to separate, each going to a different high school. The summer before school, Sharon broke up with Charles, who completely broke down. He turned to me, and I, with my soft heart, could not refuse. We became friends.

At the new school, the first person I met and who wanted to keep in touch with me was Angie. It quickly turned out that she has a difficult past. Abandoned by her family, she was a drug addict, currently living in a center for troubled youth and was completely detached from reality. She wasn't very good at studying either. As I had rather good grades, I decided, apart from friendship, to help her with her studies.

Meanwhile, Charles confessed that he had liked me for a long time. I didn't know how I felt about him, but hoping that my life was finally starting to fall into place and that I had finally met people who would appreciate me, I agreed to become his girlfriend. We were together for two months, during this time he repeatedly compared me to Sharon, even openly telling me that he would never love me the way he loved his ex-girlfriend. When he realized that his relationship with me didn't make Sharon jealous, we broke up. I didn't shed a single tear for him, but I hated him and myself for a long time.

I quickly developed a crush on another boy, whom I told Jay about, with whom I was still in contact. Jay offered to be friends with him too to increase my chances with him. And Jay did that, befriended him, and made that boy stop talking to me. Then my contact with all the people from my previous school finally ended.

Angie, on the other hand, started to do better on tests, so she found a new company ignoring me completely. At that time I got in touch with a girl named Ines. Like me, Ines suffered from depression, so we quickly became close. Angie, on the other hand, got jealous and started tormenting me and Ines for our friendship, even though she had no intention of being friends with me again.

My friendship with Ines was going well, even though it soon turned out that she suffers from borderline personality disorder, and as you know, left untreated can really spoil any relationship. However, I was forgiving despite the fact that her mood swings, suicide blackmails and aggression were vented on me. I just wanted a friend.

At that time, I liked a boy who was a year younger than me, Steven. We started dating, but it soon turned out that he was dating me for my money. When I refused to pay for everything by myself, he just stopped talking to me. At that time, Ines blamed me for any dating failures either because I didn't advise her against a particular boy, or because I believed the person she was dating was okay. Because according to her, as her friend, I should have known better.

Then my self-mutilation escalated to the point where bruises and wounds were visible on my body for everyone to see. But no one saw it or they ignored it on purpose.

I met an older guy online, Tom. We understood each other very well, he went through similar experiences as me, he was as lonely as me. I used to stay up all night to talk to him. He spoke to me so beautifully that I was convinced that there was a feeling between us. I was ready to go to him (because we lived 2 hours away from each other). However, I wanted to tell him about what I live with on a daily basis (depression etc.), because I wanted to be honest. After he found out I was self-harming, he never spoke to me again.

I went to the prom, which I didn't want to go to, just because Ines really wanted it and she said she wouldn't go without me. Ines found a partner, I didn't. I felt lonely and humiliated. After the ball, I waited all alone in the cold and in the dark, because everyone had gone home and my parents had forgotten to pick me up.

But I finished school. I didn't want to go to college, but my parents made me. During this time, I developed an eating disorder by starving myself in the hope that my attractive appearance would help me find someone close to me. I rented an apartment and died a little each day, often lying on the floor in total darkness planning my suicide.

I still kept in touch with Ines, but I also met Patricia in college. I also decided to set up an account on a dating app to meet some people there, because I still had hope. There I first met Matt and then Paul.

Ines met a boy who seemed suspicious to me from the beginning. He demanded strange things from her and behaved inappropriately in general, when I noticed that he told us that he did not like me and began to mock me and my appearance. Ines took his side. I broke off contact with her, but I didn't care because I thought my friendship with Patricia, Matt, and Paul was developing well, even though I only texted with the boys, not meeting them yet. But Patricia got into a relationship and stopped talking to me outside of college. I met with Matt, purely amicably, who quickly ended our contact after this meeting. To this day I don’t know why. Patricia stopped talking to me entirely too.

However, my friendship with Paul developed well. He introduced me to his friend Cameron, so the three of us became friends. Paul, however, started behaving in an ambiguous way towards me, hugging me, holding my hand, and affectionately treated me. Fearing another rejection, I didn't want to fall in love with him, but I finally gave in. However, it soon turned out that Paul had a girlfriend, and yet he continued to behave this way towards me. His relationship was long-distance, so soon they broke up, so I thought things would work out between us now. One day he invited me to a meeting. I was happy being convinced that it was a date. But to my surprise, Paul brought his new girlfriend. I was shocked, but explained it to myself that I must have just fooled myself that someone liked me. It took a lot of time but I finally got over it.

Then I started spending more time with Paul's friend Cameron. We got along very well, we had a similar sense of humor and the same interests. However, I knew Cameron was dating other girls at the time, so I didn't get involved in anything serious. Until one day when I was talking to Paul on discord, Paul told me that I was going to get a surprise today. And indeed, about an hour later, Cameron invited me to a meeting just the two of us. Paul knew this, but when I told him that I agreed to this meeting, Paul got very upset and ended the conversation. I was afraid of meeting Cameron because I was convinced that he and Paul had decided to make fun of me. However, meeting Cameron turned out to be a real date.

It was great, we quickly decided to start a relationship. When Paul found out about it, he confessed his feelings for me. I was shocked again because his behavior made no sense to me because he still had a girlfriend, I didn't address it, and Paul ended our friendship two days later. I understood then that the man I considered my best friend was only friends with me because he probably wanted attention, or maybe he was hoping for sex, because even when in a relationship, he still made sexually suggestive comments at me or often touched me definitely not in a friendly way.

During the next year of studies, I changed my apartment to a room in an apartment with roommates. There I was mentaly harassed by two girls, which created more trauma in me. I broke free of that when Cameron and I decided to move in together.

I left out many details, but I don't want to write that much, because some events and feelings that tormented me are not able to be described.

Cameron turned out to be a wonderful, emotional guy. We've been together for four years and I love him with all my heart. However, my eating disorders, depression and social anxiety are not letting go.

For him, I finally overcame my fear and applied for help, went to therapy, threw away the objects that I used to mutilate myself. I wanted to start my life over.

However, I am here. Therapy made me realize that I will never be healthy, that I will only learn to live with it. I understood that my parents love me, but they are completely immature, that I am not their child for them, but a trophy that is valuable to them only when they can boast of it. Cameron's friends don't even like me, none of them talk to me, even though I tried so hard. 

I'm like a parasite because I can't even go to work due to anxiety. And above all I'm a huge burden to Cameron. I can see how much nerves, life and happiness he lost being with me. I tried to break up with him so he could find a normal girlfriend, but he wouldn't listen. And I still see that no one understands me at all, not my parents, not Cameron, not the therapist. Apart from them, I have no one and I am completely alone in all this.

I feel completely useless, disgusting and meaningless. I also know that I am nothing more than that and that will never change. Everything I wrote, every person and event in my life only confirms who I am truly.

I know that I will achieve peace, let Cameron go free, and get rid of such a useless thing for this world as me only when I die.

So that's it from my side. Maybe someone I know will find this text and understand what happened to me and what influenced my decision.

Still wanna die even though life is gonna get good,"I’m gonna get my own chickens once we move to a new house! It’ll be so great having some new environments to get familiar with, new animals to chill with and whatever else omes with moving. 

I still wanna kill myself though, despite not having a method that’d work. I’ve looked around and am yet to get something that’ll work 100% of the time. Stabbing the throat/severing the carotid artery/jugular apparently wouldn’t work, slitting wrists wouldn’t work, what else is there? (All I’ve tried is a plastic bag over my head. Pathetic I know.)

I know you guys aren’t allowed to give the answers I’m after, but hopefully someone here gets how frustrating it is having everyone shove helplines and empty quotes down my throat. I get there’s the whole morality bit to not wanting to aid someone to kill themselves, but surely someone here is also seeking a painless, successful way of death?

It’s an “any day now” situation,"I have everything ready to die. I didn’t have many possessions to begin with, but just about everything is gone. Anything left in my room is up for grabs—donate or trash it. 

I guess the main problem is motivating myself to leave my apartment. I struggle with agoraphobia, but I also plan to jump. I just don’t have the resources to do it at my apartment. The building is very old and there aren’t any strong supporting beams I can use to hang myself. I tried with the closet and it broke off. Then I tried the door knob and it also broke off. My building also isn’t high enough to be a fatal fall.

It’s horrible at every level,"We live in this culture where a common insult is “get help”. So many happy, fortunate, successful people have said it to me in earnest and in jest. None of them understand what they’re saying.

I have tried to get help. I have tried doctors. Doctors are fools. They are beyond idiotic. They worship stupid, pedantic bureaucracy that shields them from ever feeling any kind of responsibility for their inability to help me or initiative to change the system that facilitates their parasitism. The same could be said for therapists and psychologists; these people are the first to tell me that they can’t help me and the last to take any initiative in providing me with any assistance. Time after time, they promise that they can help and that they’re trained professionals, and yet, time after time, they hide behind the pathetic, feeble excuse that they’re not qualified to help me. The deciding factor is the paycheck—they will say anything to me if it means handing them their hundred-dollar-an-hour paycheck, and once the transaction is made, they abandon any prospect of guiding me or assisting me. These people repeat the same oppressive platitudes over and over—“I can’t help you if you aren’t willing to help yourself.” They expect me to solve my own problems. They expect me to fix my own unhealing body and my own shattered psyche—what do I even pay these leeches for? What work do any of these brainless, heartless, spineless parasites even fucking do? I will tell you—it is nothing.

They think that my continued attendance of their treatment is proof that it’s working, but it is not. It never has been. I humor them, I pay them, and I suffer these false doctors because they are all that is there for me to pursue. These hotlines and therapists and specialists that drain my coffers and steal my time are the only people even willing to “help”. If I ever found real assistance, I would abandon them in a heartbeat. But there is no real assistance. There is no way to actually get help, like all these thoughtless bigots keep telling me to do.

No one understands this, and no one cares. I am actively encouraged to end my life at every level, by every authority and every bystander. Every manipulative comment, every stupid, pedantic, metaphysical word-trick meant to distract me from the correctness and validity of my misery is an endorsement of my suicide. This nation, this species, has nothing for me. It never has, and will never care to. 

My only regret is that I cannot hurt these people without lowering myself to their repugnant level. I cannot even die free of their poison. But goddammit, I’m going to try to.

I don’t know how, but I will find a way to broadcast my suicide to every authority I can find. I will flood their surveillance feeds with the image of my murder that they endorsed. I will stain as much of their unfair fortune with my own blood and I will curse them with the image of it. I will burn my tragedy into their rotten minds and drag them down to hell with me. I will find a way. I will make it happen.",wylaxian,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12j3v3r/its_horrible_at_every_level/,live culture common insult get help many happy fortunate successful people said earnest jest none understand saying tried get help tried doctor doctor fool beyond idiotic worship stupid pedantic bureaucracy shield ever feeling kind responsibility inability help initiative change system facilitates parasitism could said therapist psychologist people first tell help last take initiative providing assistance time time promise help trained professional yet time time hide behind pathetic feeble excuse qualified help deciding factor paycheck say anything mean handing hundred dollar hour paycheck transaction made abandon prospect guiding assisting people repeat oppressive platitude help willing help expect solve problem expect fix unhealing body shattered psyche even pay leech work brainless heartless spineless parasite even fucking tell nothing think continued attendance treatment proof working never ha humor pay suffer false doctor pursue hotlines therapist specialist drain coffer steal time people even willing help ever found real assistance would abandon heartbeat real assistance way actually get help like thoughtless bigot keep telling one understands one care actively encouraged end life every level every authority every bystander every manipulative comment every stupid pedantic metaphysical word trick meant distract correctness validity misery endorsement suicide nation specie ha nothing never ha never care regret cannot hurt people without lowering repugnant level cannot even die free poison goddammit going try know find way broadcast suicide every authority find flood surveillance feed image murder endorsed stain much unfair fortune blood curse image burn tragedy rotten mind drag hell find way make happen,horrible every level,wy la xian

I feel lonely,"I can't talk to people because I suffer from social anxiety, and I can't afford help so it's just me being constantly sad, lonely and uncomfortable. My mom tried to get me to socialize for a long time, but last time I had a panic attack so she just gave up. She blames me for being the way I am, and even though I feel guilty, I can't help it. I hate being around people my age because they remind me of something I don't have. I feel jealous seeing them get together and have fun, which makes me wonder, how do they do it? Why don't they feel scared and anxious whenever someone approaches them? How can they talk without stumbling on their words, or saying something that makes everyone hate them? I hate them so much, yet I often dream of being part of them. I fantasize of being able to do it the way they do it, to just exist without feeling uncomfortable, unfit or ashamed to exist. Whenever I try to join I feel the environment change and become awkward, even when I try to act normal. I know I suck, I know it's a torture whenever someone is forced to talk to me.

"Looks like my last day on Earth. It’s been terrible, but it’s finally over now.","I can’t stay here after this. I’ve been thinking and thinking a long time, and I’ve come to the realization that I’m not meant to be alive. Everything that’s good to me leaves. I can’t be saved, I can’t be happy, I can’t be okay. Mentally and physically I’m absolutely drained. Idk what more I could’ve done on my part to try. But maybe it wasn’t meant to be. My brain and people around me told me there would be better days. They were right and wrong at the same time. The bad days badly outweigh the good ones. I take so many losses and I’m tired of attempting a bounce back from them. At a glance I’m failure, loser, with no friends or family, and there was never a point in my being alive in the first place. I plan on having a few more talks with a couple of nice people I know for some peace of mind before I go, then jumping into a river. I know I won’t have a funeral or a decent send off, but that’s kind of what I want. Just to fade away like I never existed. This life was hard, but I wouldn’t want to make it harder on others or leave a burden on others, or make them sad.

completely lost hope for life,"I’m extremely depressed. Some days I find it hard to take a shower. I’ve tried therapy and it works for a short period I feel relieved but then I slip right back into the darkness of depression. I feel awful, I just want to be happy. I just turned 22 years old, and if I’m being honest I have no desire to live anymore. My father lost his job, I’m not rich. I see all these people living my dream life and I feel like all my goals and desires are so unattainable. It’s not fair, I had such big goals and dreams but in my core I feel like I will never be lucky, I will never achieve the success I truly want. All I ever wanted was to have a nice life, and be able to provide for my family. People have crucified me for wanting nice things, saying it’s shallow. I have completely given up on life. Dropped out of college, zero friends, my family thinks Im a lazy failure.   I cry every single day, it’s almost as if I am mourning my old self. I used to be drop dead gorgeous when I was 15-18, I could have been a model ( it was my dream ). I suffer with heath issues, my long beautiful hair turned into short and very thin. I went down a wrong path, hung around the wrong crowd got extremely visible tattoos and am now in deep regret. I’m removing my tattoos but it’s taking forever and it’s extremely painful. I feel like I’m running out of time. I self sabotaged. It seems like my dream life is just an illusion, that I am a nobody and will live a life I don’t want. What is the point in keeping on ……. I really want to end my life, I feel hopeless. I feel so guilty for thinking this way, that there are others out there with way worse situations than me, and I am grateful for many things, but this is the truth of how I feel.

never enough,"its always almost enough. my whole life it’s always almost there for me but never quite right. when i get my injury money i’ll be happy. i got it and i still want to kill myself.  being in school again i thought might. i’ll be dropping my classes tonight, i just can’t bring myself to care. 

someone told me today i have to start taking myself seriously. how do i do that when i don’t think there’s a future? every human experience is more or less the same i think. that’s why we all connect with the sad movies, the breakup songs, the victory laps, the financial success stories. there’s a chance that it might be better and in order for it to be better the present has to change. 

i think the present has always been changing. that’s not the problem for me. i have 50k in my account, no more constant credit card debt. but i can’t hold a job because i’m depressed and lazy and can’t find a reason to do something that protects my long term future when i don’t care about saving the present. i feel like my whole life i’ve been just getting by with just enough. 

once i fix the relationship with my mom i’ll feel healed. once i have another good date night i’ll feel secure. once my dad tells me he really is proud i’ll feel validated. why isn’t it enough?? recently someone asked me why the idea of a future with the love of your life isn’t enough of a motivator to wake up every morning, go to work, work on yourself, and move forward. there’s just one answer. i don’t know. 

i don’t know what to do anymore. i want to kill myself so bad. but instead i’m going to drive home and repeat the same day over tomorrow because i don’t care enough to save myself from it. i hope the people i love change their mind soon so i can kill myself with no guilt.",mixmenace,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12j9n99/never_enough/,always almost enough whole life always almost never quite right get injury money happy got still want kill school thought might dropping class tonight bring care someone told today start taking seriously think future every human experience le think connect sad movie breakup song victory lap financial success story chance might better order better present ha change think present ha always changing problem 50k account constant credit card debt hold job depressed lazy find reason something protects long term future care saving present feel like whole life getting enough fix relationship mom feel healed another good date night feel secure dad tell really proud feel validated enough recently someone asked idea future love life enough motivator wake every morning go work work move forward one answer know know anymore want kill bad instead going drive home repeat day tomorrow care enough save hope people love change mind soon kill guilt,never enough,mix menace

"idk, i don’t have a title","
It’s been a hard few months. I’m away in college now and it’s strange. Three years ago I was planning on killing myself when I went away. I wanted to wait until I was off on my own. But then, miraculously, I got better. I found new meaning and changed my perspective. 

I don’t want to kill myself anymore. But, part of me wishes I at least tried. When I was suicidal it was all silent. I kept it from my family and friends completely. Even if I hadn’t gotten better they would’ve still been confident sending me off to college in another state. Which was kind of the point, I suppose. I was gonna go off and find some place to die quietly like a cat. 

But I don’t want that anymore. I’m here because there’s things I want to study, things I want to do. But, I just wonder if I hadn’t gotten better, who would’ve known to stop me? I have no one in my life I trust enough to talk about this with other than Internet strangers who don’t know my name.

My campus is small, quiet. And at night when all the commuters have gone home it’s practically a ghost town. If I had found myself up on the roof of the Fine Arts Department late one night, the only person who’d realistically be around to stop me is the hungover 20-something year old security girl who works night shift sometimes. 
And, I don’t know about you, but I don’t think she’s really qualified to handle those kinds of situations. 

idk… I don’t wish I killed myself. I just wish I had my pain acknowledged. Validated. Months ago I considered self-harm, just to feel something in some cathartic way (in my efforts to hide my depression from my family, I’ve repressed my emotions to the point where I can’t even cry anymore. The emotions, the pain, it all just festers inside with no outlet). But, I’ve seen from victims of self harm how addicting it can be. And I’ve decided against it since then. I figured therapy would be better, ultimately. 

It wasn’t. But it doesn’t matter cause I can’t pay for it anymore. I told my therapist all of this and my subscription expired before she could respond, so fml.

It feels like everything is coming to a natural end,"Hey, I made it to 34! That’s a lot longer than I meant to go when I tried to kill myself at 15. I’ll try not to get into specifics on methods so I don’t break the community rules.

I don’t have a good life. I have a partner, but no friends. My mental health has been deteriorating since I was a teenager. I’ve had several breakdowns over the years and several experiences that caused PTSD. I left my job almost 3 years ago. My doctors didn’t think I should be working anymore because of the toll it was taking on my mental health. It took a few months, but I was able to have a psych evaluation done to pin down exactly what I was going through: major depressive disorder, severe anxiety, agoraphobia, BPD, and the list goes on. The evaluation specifically encouraged me to apply for social security disability because they believed it would take a long time for me to get better, if it was possible at all. My partner supported me in pursuing this at the time.

I spent the next two years cycling through therapists while jumping through the hoops of the disability application process. My partner spent the time cycling through jobs to help us get by. Eventually he stopped working and couldn’t find another job. He hasn’t had a steady job in almost a year. It’s caused great financial hardship and stress. Speaking of financial hardship, my disability case was finally reviewed by a judge late last year. With everything I’ve been through and all of my documentation, my lawyer said it was a “slam dunk.” Except I ended up being placed in front of a judge that my lawyer warned me very rarely awarded anything to younger people or those without visible disabilities. So, surprise! I lost my case. No chance of appeal. Everything was tied up with a nice little bow. And my dream of having a little assistance to get by every month was gone. I guess that’s what they call “falling through the cracks.”

This year has been especially hard. I haven’t made any progress in therapy because our financial situation has me so constantly worried and depressed that I can’t bring myself to imagine the possibility that some miracle might come along to make things better. We’ve gone completely through savings and my parents are helping us with bills, what little they can. My partner and I are arguing so often that I’ve learned to keep my mouth shut for fear of being yelled at. I’ve tried reaching out to strangers online for someone to talk to. A way to feel like I’m not alone. I’ve been ghosted by anyone I’ve had a long conversation with. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong, but I’m socially awkward, so it’s probably my fault. I’m not looking for connections here. God knows I’ve had enough of the “it gets better” crowd. It’s been almost 20 years since I first tried to kill myself, and I can tell you nothing has gotten better.

I think Saturday night is a good time to take care of things. It lets me rewatch some of my favorite movies and listen to some of my favorite songs before I’m gone. Gives me time to write a note so no one is left with too many questions and clear out anything online I don’t want people to find. It feels like everything is finally coming to a natural end. And I like the idea of not having to worry about next week.

“Your life has just started…”,"I’m only 18. Just turned in November. Doesn’t matter though, because my life still isn’t going anywhere. 

I’m working a job with a boss that I hate, I’m failing 2 of the easiest college classes I’ll ever have to take, my spending habits are so atrocious that I’ve never had a full tank of gas without having to ask my mom for a loan, I gave up on therapy cause I can’t talk things out with strangers, I gave up on medication cause I’d forget to take it and lose the motivation to continue, and I hate myself.

I hate the way I look, I hate the way that I’m bad at my only two hobbies, both of which are supposed to be coping mechanisms but they stress me out and give me anxiety. 

I have no plans for my future. I wanted to be a gaming content creator but I can’t even find the motivation anymore to create said content. I’m not even funny so how could I build an audience? I also suffer from ADHD so trying to create content results in procrastination and distractions. 

If I’m not working or at school I’m in my room playing games. I can rarely hang out with my friends cause of my busy schedule. 

All the shit happening in the US is horrible too. Just more reasons why I don’t wanna live here or live at all, but I can’t afford to leave. 

I’m just so tired. My parents don’t understand what I’m going through, and their constant harassment about school (which I’m being forced to go to) is stressing me out even more. I can’t even talk to them anymore without getting annoyed or mad sometimes.

I just want to be the social, happy little girl that I used to be. 

I’ve thought about it. Attempting suicide and failing just so they could see. But I’m too afraid to. If I didn’t have anxiety I’d have been gone years ago. I can’t do it. I’m scared and I’d feel so guilty. My parents went through hell trying to conceive me, and my friends who are also suffering from mental health need me. I couldn’t possibly leave without seeing my brother again either. He’s in the military, and he’s been gone so long it feels like I’m an only child. 

I just want this pain to end. If I could end the pain without death then I need that help now. I’m so tired, I don’t know what to do.

All the ambitions I used to have, they’re gone. I don’t want anything in life anymore. I have nothing to look forward to. I can’t talk to anyone cause when I do, I feel like I’m a burden and it’s not like they can do anything to help me.

Caught covid because family forced me to go on a trip.,"i wish it would kill me finally. 

people are so unfair. they dont even consider peoples health when scheduling social events. ive been wanting to be a shut in for a long time because i couldnt hold a job and all the family trips back and forth to the province made me sick. socializing makes me sick. 
ive been getting dizzy in long drives but i usually have to tag along instead of being left alone at home because my mom is afraid id kill myself. 

the last long drive was the longest, 13 1/2 hours on easter sunday. double the usual time. we visited relatives from holy thursday until sunday. and i had to participate in the good friday procession. my mom caught covid from one of her sisters who i am banned from seeing because im unvaccinated. we found out that my aunt had covid the day after we arrived home. this aunt played mah jongg at her house every day, even after one of her friends caught covid and they had to stop it for a while. 

mom took a self antigen test as soon as we found out. i was sitting beside her the whole ride home and she was already starting to feel sick then, so im sure i caught the bug 100%. been sick since monday. 

people never learn to reduce their social demands, even after the pandemic. another reminder why i want to withdraw from society as a whole. i wish theyd do more than ""sorry youre sick, take some meds"" and do more to prevent things that would lead to people getting sick. because mom and i are definitely not the only ones to spend 10+ in heavy traffic last sunday. im sure lots of other people got sick too. not to mention the pollution from all those cars. 

i dont usually mind traditions but when the conditions are that bad, then the tradition isnt worth it imho. imagine meeting with relatives for christmas and not being able to enjoy new years because of people getting sick during the holidays. 

i want to die. this world isnt worth living in and i dont have any more reasons to live. last night i was having a fever and a meltdown, and i lashed out at the person i love the most. what that person didnt know is that my whole life was flashing in front of my eyes right then and i felt all the hurts from before. 

i lost my bff of 6 years because he had a jealous girlfriend who wouldnt let him talk to exes. it was that easy for him to go no contact, after all ive done for him. he was a broken man when i found him and i built up his confidence. i proofread his works for publication and he won a national award. i helped him review for civil service and he passed. i taught him various things like card games, board games, interesting movies, and how to get steam. not to boast but i practically made that guy and now that gf reaps all the benefits. 

i know im unattractive and boring but i wish someone would stay when ive already devoted so much to them. im always afraid of losing the few friends i have now. and im afraid of getting too invested in someone or something just to fail miserably again, like my studies and work experiences. its so hard to commit to anything and my separation anxiety is through the roof lately. 

i want to be someones favorite person because thats the only thing that gives me a reason to live. everything else is fleeting, people come and go and i know i wont survive alone. im too weak to be alone, i dont have what it takes to take care of myself. so why cant i just die? im a burden and unwanted anyway. i didnt ask to exist. people are so unfair. life is so unfair.",SeiOfTheEast,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12jalcu/caught_covid_because_family_forced_me_to_go_on_a/,wish would kill finally people unfair dont even consider people health scheduling social event ive wanting shut long time couldnt hold job family trip back forth province made sick socializing make sick ive getting dizzy long drive usually tag along instead left alone home mom afraid id kill last long drive wa longest 13 1 2 hour easter sunday double usual time visited relative holy thursday sunday participate good friday procession mom caught covid one sister banned seeing im unvaccinated found aunt covid day arrived home aunt played mah jongg house every day even one friend caught covid stop mom took self antigen test soon found wa sitting beside whole ride home wa already starting feel sick im sure caught bug 100 sick since monday people never learn reduce social demand even pandemic another reminder want withdraw society whole wish theyd sorry youre sick take med prevent thing would lead people getting sick mom definitely one spend 10 heavy traffic last sunday im sure lot people got sick mention pollution car dont usually mind tradition condition bad tradition isnt worth imho imagine meeting relative christmas able enjoy new year people getting sick holiday want die world isnt worth living dont reason live last night wa fever meltdown lashed person love person didnt know whole life wa flashing front eye right felt hurt lost bff 6 year jealous girlfriend wouldnt let talk ex wa easy go contact ive done wa broken man found built confidence proofread work publication national award helped review civil service passed taught various thing like card game board game interesting movie get steam boast practically made guy gf reaps benefit know im unattractive boring wish someone would stay ive already devoted much im always afraid losing friend im afraid getting invested someone something fail miserably like study work experience hard commit anything separation anxiety roof lately want someone favorite person thats thing give reason live everything else fleeting people come go know wont survive alone im weak alone dont take take care cant die im burden unwanted anyway didnt ask exist people unfair life unfair,caught covid family forced go trip,sei east

I’m tired,"I’m just really tired of this. I used to hold on for those little moments. Talking to a friend, holding my cat, having a beer outside, that was enough for me. But now idk. There’s this overwhelming feeling of sadness hanging over everything I do. I feel like I’m just biding my time, but ultimately it will lead to the same thing.

I’ve tried blocking it out. I went through some shit recently that has completely destroyed me. I took edibles and Xanax every day for months to try and block it out, and then I looked into the mirror 2 weeks ago and hated what I saw.

I lost friends that I deeply loved. One of them was my person, or so I thought, and she threw me away without so much as a goodbye and it has left me deeply traumatized. I lost my job, and I am buried in debt. My father has cancer, which is conflicting because my family and I have an extremely toxic relationship. I’m a strong person, but I feel worn down to a shell of my former self. I feel like a burden. I feel like a ghost. 

I’ve been trying to get back up to save myself, but it doesn’t even feel worth it anymore. I wish it would stop. I’ve spent so many nights wishing that I wouldn’t wake up the next day.

I want to die but I can’t because I have no viable suicide options :(,And it’s really starting to bother me. If I had a gun I would’ve pulled the trigger long ago. But considering I’ve been in and out of mental institutions the chances of me being able to purchase a firearm legally is next to impossible. I’m too afraid of heights to jump off a building. My biggest fear is drowning so that knocks that option away. Cutting is not a realistic suicide option and far too painful. People say suicide is the “easy way out” but it seems like the hard way. The amount of courage to take your own life is insane. I’m way too scared to do it but I’m so done with life that I want it to be over. I just need a gun sigh. Or I wish I owned a garage so I could just die in my car from smoke inhalation. It’s like every single moment of being alive is very painful for me and death is on my mind 24/7.,ironmanrocks525,8,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12is6st/i_want_to_die_but_i_cant_because_i_have_no_viable/,really starting bother gun would pulled trigger long ago considering mental institution chance able purchase firearm legally next impossible afraid height jump building biggest fear drowning knock option away cutting realistic suicide option far painful people say suicide easy way seems like hard way amount courage take life insane way scared done life want need gun sigh wish owned garage could die car smoke inhalation like every single moment alive painful death mind 24 7,want die viable suicide option,ironman rock 525

My mom told me to “stop playing the victim.”,"


So my mom yelled at me while on a call with my boyfriend. Told me to clean my room up because I can’t lay on the couch all day. My room is covered in mouse shit. It’s in my bed and in my clothes. At one point I was growing mold in my room. I went to the bathroom to text him about why I left suddenly because it’s the only lockable door. 

Then my mom came up to the door. She must know I’ve been cutting. She said, “Cutting won’t make it go away. You need to grow up. Stop playing the victim. We deserve to live in a clean house too.”

She came to the door again as I was writing. Yelled at me again. I’m not even cutting. I did a few hours ago but not rn. She commented on how fat and lazy I was. 

I hate this house. No one cares. No matter what I do or how I feel they don’t give a shit about me. My dad is trying to take me off my medicine and my therapist stopped sending me links to our telehealth meetings. I don’t know where to go from here.

I want to escape this world,"I really don't know what I'm doing with my life anymore. My parents divorced, moved to a new house, and lost 2 jobs. all within a few months of each other and I feel like I'm going mad. one of my jobs I had for 7 years, only for it to close down to low staff and now I can't go back. The second job was only seasonal that basically set me up for failure by not training me properly, right before the hollidays and had me work in the back COMPLETELY ALONE!!! Expecting me to clean an entire department everyday without managing supervision or help (had regular mental breakdowns during). Then fired me for ""not coming in while sick"". Haven't had a job since new years and my mom has forced me to get a job at a hospital where I know ill hate because both my sister and dad both work there both of which I have less then fond relationships with. Not to mention I don't like germs or people all to much. Other than that between my siblings and I, I am the one who is most ignored. When got there new rooms with new furniture, and I get the back corner basement room with a hole in wall because of mice. Had to buy a new bed because my dad decided to keep mine from the old house because ""it was comfortable"" despite having an expensive bed of his own that was perfectly fine before throwing it out. Now even being at the old house doesn't feel good because he converted all our old rooms into spare rooms with a bunch of junk in them. I haven't even unpacked my own things and its been months because I don't have anywhere to put anything. All I have is a desk for my computer and my bed on the floor.

I feel like the only way to redeem myself is to die,"I keep being told over and over that my problems are not important. Over and over... while I was struggling in high school, my brother was failing. When I was failing, my brother got a girl pregnant. While I was in college, too paralyzed to keep trying, a family member is hurt at work in a permanent, life-changing way. At the end of college I meet a girl, and her family is filled with problems including prison, babies, drugs, and violence. Throughout our relationship I'm not allowed to have problems, yet constantly accused of cheating. Eventually (4 years in, after i finally save up enough for us to move) she breaks up with me to hook up with a coworker she just met. 


And then there's now. I've been with someone else for years now. Things have devolved to the point of screaming at each other over stupid misunderstandings. I feel like I must be insane because I remember things differently when these fights break out. Regardless, any problems I have are swiftly stomped out by her much bigger, important problems. I feel like it will never be my turn to have someone help me carry my problems.

She, nor anyone else, sees I'm being crushed a little bit more every day. I'm not allowed to have alone time, I've had to give up using my PC unless she's asleep or at class. I'm just trying to live... it feels like too much to ask.

I feel like there's only one way this will end for me, and I'm scared. I know that everything will be better for everyone once it's all done. If I fail its just going to look like attention seeking. I can't just leave either, she's threatened self harm if I try to leave. I want to support her, but I can't even support myself anymore. I'm so scared. I keep feeling like even if I don't want to, I might end up doing it anyway once I get pushed down too far.

I find that life has no meaning,"I sit there in my room doing nothing but alleviate the eternal boredom i have to suffer. Even if i could talk to someone, i have terrible social skills, so i am left all alone, empty, existing just because. I feel as if it won’t get better than this. I’m just a quiet sack of uselessness that is so unloveable it is disgusting to even look at me. I ponder as i always do, thinking “what is the meaning of all this”, “Do i just suffer eternally with no gain at all to it.” People like me suffer the thoughts of suicide and ending it all. These thoughts don’t help you at all obviously, and it just leaves me there depressed, only to laugh at how meaningless my life is, and knowing that i can’t change it at all, and i’m afraid to even try. I ponder with my ambient music thinking these thoughts that will only destroy me inside. I have walked my daily path of self-destruction and it only leaves me with one option: Suicide. And the funny thing is i am too scared to even do it unless i have a gun in my hands ready to blow my brains out. It is a sad world for some of us, and people don’t seem to care about this side of world at all. Some people are even forced to think nothing of it and keep going and they fake happiness enough that they wish that was what they really felt, but in reality it isn’t.

I think tonight might finally be the night. I think I’d be doing everyone a favor.,"I’ve been coming up with a pretty detailed plan for around a month now. Have pretty narrowly avoided using it a few times. 

My husband has been away from me for four months for work. I’m finally supposed to move to him on Friday. We were talking tonight and he barely acknowledged me. He rarely does anymore. I always have to text first. Always have to call first. Have to bug him about getting the things that would make it possible for me to actually move to him. Every time I do call he hangs up quickly because he’s working or with friends or “too tired.”

I made a lighthearted joke this evening that I wish he would get a different job and he hung up on me. I don’t think he even cares about me and my feelings. I have dropped everything to move with him twice now. All of my dreams have been put on hold. I’ve given up dreams entirely for him. I’ve left the job I love and was good at. I’m not acting or singing or dancing anymore. I can’t remember the last time I wrote anything but the draft for a suicide note. I know he’s working very hard and he likes his job, but he’s putting everything before me. I thought when we got married it was an agreement that we would put each other first. I’ve put him first so many times and he never puts me first. 

I’ve worked my ass off the past month getting our stuff packed up, our cats settled with a friend that has agreed to take care of them while we’re in an apartment that won’t allow them, looking for a new job, having to explain over and over again to friends and family why I’m leaving and why he didn’t take me sooner. I’m exhausted from the work and he doesn’t even acknowledge that I’ve been doing it. Doesn’t even seem to recognize that he up and left with just a few days notice and left me to deal with all the pieces. 

He doesn’t even know how shitty and suicidal I’ve felt. I haven’t told him because I know it upsets him. I’ve kept quite and just hoped it would get better once we’re together. I’m starting to think it won’t. 

If I killed myself he wouldn’t have to worry about me anymore. He wouldn’t have the extra costs I come with. He wouldn’t have me nagging. He could get rid of my dog he hates so much. He’d be free to do whatever he wants.

I will commit if i have to.,"If my life keeps going downhill and if i keep getting hit with things that make me sad i will commit suicide because i am DONE listening to people how i should handle the situations im in.

My parents dont want to help me get a therapist because they think i am only sad because my ex broke up with me. Its not that i have a lot going on in my life and its a wave of bad things and I really am getting suicidal by it because whats the point of life if i can only be happy for a little bit before my dark thoughts take over and I go crazy in my head I can't sleep normally because I keep thinking about things like my ex or my group of friends that is still slowly breaking down or losing more friends or afraid of my future or scared that I will never find someone again because my biggest dream is to have a family of my own blood and dna and just have a nice group of friends without problems but I had everything 1 year ago but everything falls on me at once and I lose everything .

"Sometimes you just don’t trust yourself, but you’re alone.","I found my husband using. It’s serious, he’s in rehab. Our entire lives ended, it feels like. I have to keep it together for him and be encouraging. It’s heavy stuff, as heavy as it gets I think. I never would have seen it coming. We don’t drink don’t smoke. Go to bed at 8pm. He goes to the gym we both have professional careers. I found the syringes. 

I’ve been alone here since Saturday. I’m diagnosed bipolar. I left my garage opener with my friends and told them that if I have a breakdown to please feed and take care of the cats if I get institutionalized. But I felt like I didn’t mean it. I felt like it wasn’t my intent to get institutionalized. 

I have therapy tomorrow, and a meeting with my psychiatrist. It comes in waves. This isn’t his first or second rehab. Nothing helps. He called me, I have no contact with him otherwise. But he called me and told me he thought he could do it forever. Some came in the mail yesterday and I flushed it. I cried on the floor for days. I haven’t eaten. I withdrew from school. I keep calling people. They give advice they say they’re sorry and it all sounds like white noise. I have the hotline on standby. I’ve called before. He was my main support. My lifeline. And he can’t be that anymore. I’m fairly sure the stress of having to be emotionally available to me is what pushed him into relapse. There is no trust, I don’t know how to go on. I don’t know how a life can be rebuilt. I don’t want to leave. I don’t want to be without him. But I don’t know how to go on or if there is a point. It’s pain after pain. It’s just short spurts of sub par life between hurt so deep it feels like it’s easier to just not. 

So I’m here. Watching 90 day fiancé. I’m alone in this whole city. There are cameras on the house and protection under the bed. But I’ll never feel safe again. I don’t think I ever will again.

Why do I hate myself despite being “successful”/achieving my goals?,"


Hey all, 

I don’t know why, but I find reaching out to strangers very comforting, and feel like I can be open without it changing the perception of me that the close friends/family have of me. 
I also want to state when I say successful, I mean I have reached the goals I set for myself and not in the sense of being an arrogant asshole. 

Just to start with some background, for the past 1-2 years, I have been really struggling with erratic sleep patterns, anxiety/depression, and strong suicide ideation. 
I started talking to a therapist around 4 months ago when the thoughts got very strong and I started meticulously planning the details. My therapist is a great guy, and I really enjoy talking to him/getting his advice. I also got prescribed bipolar/sleep(lexapro) medicine by a psychiatrist as I have a family history of it, but that didn’t seem to help much as my sleep was still ridiculous. In high school, I was always someone who went to bed late(around 12-1), but now in college, I am frequently pulling all nighters or going to bed at 4-6am and not waking up until 3-4pm. It really sucks because I am missing all my classes and the cycle continues as I have to keep up with work. I will say that I do make things worse as I tend to procrastinate all tests/hw, and I am stem major at a top 10 Uni. 
The thing is no one around me notices how miserable I am or I am able to hide it well due to my sarcastic/reserved personality with friends, and the fact I am doing well in school and internship wise.  I just got a big interview, and did well, which made me happy for all of 2 hours before I started to become suicidal again. I feel I am constantly beating up on myself and always so stressed out. It’s been this way for as long as I can remember, even when I got into my Uni(a long term goal of mine), I wasn’t happy about it for long, and started obsessing over the next goal. I have tried to control these thoughts with meditation, medication, talking to people, and planning big lifestyle changes(gym,food, social media), but nothing works. I still hate myself and I just don’t get it. 
Its not like I have troubles in the social scene or family either. I have a loving girlfriend, great friends, and a close family. Yet I still feel so miserable with myself and that I am this big failure, or life isn’t worth living. 

I guess this was just a rant, but if at all possible, I’d just like to hear what everyone thinks about my situation? Does anyone else suffer from self deprecating thoughts? If you got over it, how? 
Tldr: 
Sorry if this made no sense, but to summarize: 
I feel like a failure despite measurable success, and that I should end my life to stop the feelings of hatred I have for myself and general unhappiness.",himothyjamess,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12jbpjf/why_do_i_hate_myself_despite_being/,hey know find reaching stranger comforting feel like open without changing perception close friend family also want state say successful mean reached goal set sense arrogant asshole start background past 1 2 year really struggling erratic sleep pattern anxiety depression strong suicide ideation started talking therapist around 4 month ago thought got strong started meticulously planning detail therapist great guy really enjoy talking getting advice also got prescribed bipolar sleep lexapro medicine psychiatrist family history seem help much sleep wa still ridiculous high school wa always someone went bed late around 12 1 college frequently pulling nighters going bed 4 6am waking 3 4pm really suck missing class cycle continues keep work say make thing worse tend procrastinate test hw stem major top 10 uni thing one around notice miserable able hide well due sarcastic reserved personality friend fact well school internship wise got big interview well made happy 2 hour started become suicidal feel constantly beating always stressed way long remember even got uni long term goal mine happy long started obsessing next goal tried control thought meditation medication talking people planning big lifestyle change gym food social medium nothing work still hate get like trouble social scene family either loving girlfriend great friend close family yet still feel miserable big failure life worth living guess wa rant possible like hear everyone think situation doe anyone else suffer self deprecating thought got tldr sorry made sense summarize feel like failure despite measurable success end life stop feeling hatred general unhappiness,hate despite successful achieving goal,thy james

"Sleep or die, I guess.","I’ve had thoughts of suicide on and off since I was like 14 and the best coping mechanism I’d managed to develop even still is sleeping. I’ve had brief periods absent from these thoughts and others where they seemed overwhelming, even driving me as far as writing a note for my loved ones to read after.

Unfortunately for the past couple of years, my life has jus been going down hill. My support system in the past was mainly a large friend circle that I no longer enjoy being a part of, I’m living at simultaneously the shittiest AND most expensive place I’ve ever lived at, I failed every goal I ever had so many times that they’ve ceased to become something I even dream of attaining, and I’m still making minimum wage because I have no skills, connections, or drive.

At this point I spend hours every day thinking about killing myself, hoping with all my being that my heart will give out or I’ll have a aneurism or get cancer or that anything would happen that could shorten my life significantly. I sleep like 5 times a day and it’s getting in the way of the few responsibilities I have, I don’t know what else to do.",Moistpocalypse,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12j1xrm/sleep_or_die_i_guess/,thought suicide since wa like 14 best coping mechanism managed develop even still sleeping brief period absent thought others seemed overwhelming even driving far writing note loved one read unfortunately past couple year life ha jus going hill support system past wa mainly large friend circle longer enjoy part living simultaneously shittiest expensive place ever lived failed every goal ever many time ceased become something even dream attaining still making minimum wage skill connection drive point spend hour every day thinking killing hoping heart give aneurism get cancer anything would happen could shorten life significantly sleep like 5 time day getting way responsibility know else,sleep die guess,moist po c aly p e
Is it concerning that I plan my suicide?,"Ever since I was 14, I have had suicidal thoughts. they were not present all the time, but would automatically pop up if I faced even the smallest of stress. Every since then, I had planned my suicide. i planned how I would die, when (to a specific day), and what I will leave behind. The day approaches closer, and the thoughts don't stop.  I am not even completely convinced if these truly are suicidal thoughts, since they aren't having as detrimental of an effect on my life as I have seen in SM, although they do have a strong effect on my mental health.

Why do I even try.,"I know that I'm not that important for people to care about me. Everyone has their own lives. I'd like to find some sort of happiness or see a future I can work towards or a path to take too. But every step saps so much energy when I don't even see what I want to do. When I 'm just trapped here. Trying to change doesn't work when I've been pushed down. Things I used to love just make me anxious now, because after all, what use is it if I can't do anything with it? What use am I if I don't carry worth in reputation or monetary value?  
I can't help but think that I'd be better off dead. Nothing seems to be working. Everything piles up on and on.   
People say everyone has something value to contribute to the world. But I just don't. I'm mediocre at everything I do. I have no passion for anything. No passion for life. No passion for living.   
I'm living by the second. Consistently living in the past. I keep trying but today is one of those breaking point days.   
I keep wanting to self-harm, and maybe if I'm lucky, I'll get an infection or lose enough blood to die.   
Sometimes, I just wish that I died in that near accident I caused from zoning out while driving.   
The thoughts just won't stop. I know that I'm worthless and useless and ugly and stupid and talentless already. So why won't they just leave me alone. I have no ambitions.   
I feel like I keep on blaming and resenting others. I'm so tired of myself. Why can't I just accept that I'll never be good enough for anyone. For anything. I know that I'm no good at anything, but why do I even keep trying.",nostalgia_ridden,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12j8g86/why_do_i_even_try/,know important people care everyone ha life like find sort happiness see future work towards path take every step sap much energy even see want trapped trying change work pushed thing used love make anxious use anything use carry worth reputation monetary value help think better dead nothing seems working everything pile people say everyone ha something value contribute world mediocre everything passion anything passion life passion living living second consistently living past keep trying today one breaking point day keep wanting self harm maybe lucky get infection lose enough blood die sometimes wish died near accident caused zoning driving thought stop know worthless useless ugly stupid talentless already leave alone ambition feel like keep blaming resenting others tired accept never good enough anyone anything know good anything even keep trying,even try,nostalgia ridden

"No title, just venting","I need to vent, I am losing my mind and having a breakdown

I don’t even know how to start this shit. I am so embarrassed and ashamed of myself for believing I had a chance with a woman who doesn’t even know me irl. I never had anyone like me back, love me so much that it feels like a dream. I been through so much since I was a little girl, was SA’d (ChildOnChild), bullied, excluded, and never felt fully accepted for me. I have autism, schizoaffective, major depressive disorder. I am literally struggling to function at all in this life, I feel so far behind and usless its insane. I feel unworthy a little bit, or better much lacking in life. Never had a lover, an awesome career, a nice friend group, etc. Nope just a 19 year old who is mentally fucked up stays in the house all the time because the outside makes me overstimulated and makes me freak out. The bright lights, noises, people, I lose it. I cant get my ass to do anything, cant even get up to take a fucking bath, cant eat right, cant even clean my room or get anything productive done. I lost my step dad, great grandma, grandma, older sister, great great grandma, I lost so many people and is still dealing with grief, my grandmas (yes all of them) happened literally back to back. I lost hope of getting with the only girl I really liked, loved, saw myself in her, I felt like I could finally find a place where I am accepted, nope just a parasocial dream that lasted fucking 3 years embarrassing right yep thats me thats me I’m insane and a joke. Living is hard. So many people have abundance of things and I am stuck in a dark place for over a decade. Living feels like so much work. To see her really love someone else hurts, I must admit because once again I am alone, excluded, and feel like I will never have anything nice or something at most. On top of that she is straight, cant get mad at that right, its just me being a gay woman I am even more excluded and unrepresented. I see all these happy couples showing pda and being affectionate, can openly express their sexuality without it having to be taboo, or shamed, guess what all of them are hetro relationships, even the bi or pan women be in hetro relationships so me being lesbian m its no chance for me. I barely get crushes, only been in love once but that was parasocial, but when I did have a crush or fell in love the girl who I had a crush on led me on and basically dumped me after 5 days of “dating”, and well the girl I loved is straight, so yeah Im fucked. I don’t stand a chance, its fucking useless. Maybe if I was a straight guy I would have a better pool or chance at this but nope I am an autistic black nerdy schizoaffective woman who is 19 and is fucked up in every way. I hate romance and people. I hate life, this capitalist society etc. I hate this shit. Also please no bs stories of optimism or whatever I have heard it so many times yet i am still not given the time of day or even remotely worth it in this fucked up society.

I want to kill myself by the end of this week,"I've been thinking about this for a long time, but I have seriously been considering it again these past few weeks. I even tested out a plan, though I'm unsure if I can go through with it; survival instincts and all that. Chances are I won't succeed, but the point is that I definitely don't want to exist right now. 

I have no special talents. Little to no friends all my life. An overbearing, sensitive, useless, and socially inept mess of a person, I can't even do some of the most basic things in life. How on earth am I meant to survive as an adult soon when I am barely surviving now? To also think that it gets harder? It feels pointless, like I'm wasting my time living and being an annoyance to those around me when I could be dead and gone.

I'm aware the things I've mentioned above are incredibly corny, and it's all been said and thought 
before so many times by so many others, but those are only the surface level details of why I feel so miserable being alive. I wish I could function 'normally' and get on with my life instead of moping around like this. 

I thought I'd be better by now. I thought this black wave in my head would go away. I thought I'd be able to thrive with a fresh start at college and get these amazing grades which I will focus all my energy into, which eventually will help me become a functioning adult.

Obviously, as it turns out, that was all wishful thinking.

I genuinely just can't be bothered to live. I am supposed to go back to college after this week. I was supposed to find somewhere to do my work experience as I currently have none, as well as finish the assignments which I missed due to my many absences, but I am stuck on this idea that I will be gone by then so there is no point, as some kind of form of sick motivation I guess.

But I'm scared. What if I fail and end up in a vegetative state? What if nothing happens, and I'm forced to have to just... keep living miserably. I don't even like doing anything anymore these days. Everything I do reminds me of my depression. I never even asked to be born in the first place!!

I think I just want somebody to save me. I need some older, wiser being that I can cry to. That I can rely on. That I can just *be* with as they guide me through all these heavy feelings. Someone who cares and acts as some sort of parental figure to me, I want this so terribly badly to the point where I actively seek someone out to fill this role.

I had someone like this - my old English teacher. I still have her email, but I would hate to burden her with this, and I am afraid of becoming as attached and obsessed as I was before - I'm doing a decent job not thinking about her as much. I guess having to leave her behind and returning to a life without a mentor/mother-figure just enhances all these feelings. I anticipated it to be horrible, yet nothing could prepare me for such emptiness.

If all goes wrong, I have considered opening up to my current student mentor at college about my suicidal thoughts. She already knows I struggle mentally, and I meet with her every two weeks to discuss my progress through my course and how I am feeling (which is often barely ever truthful). This is honestly a terrifying thought as I am awful at verbalizing my thoughts/feelings, and I am really not sure what would happen next since I'm still a minor. But I'm quite fond of her and really enjoy her presence for some reason. Also she is qualified in this kind of area, so this is kind of a last resort if I even do gather the courage to tell her. If that's even a good idea.

I'm sorry if this is all so weird, I needed somewhere to vent my frustrations. If anyone read this far and has any suggestions on how, or even if, I should approach this subject with my student mentor if I do live to get the chance to, I would be grateful.",grrrlsonfilm,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12j80o3/i_want_to_kill_myself_by_the_end_of_this_week/,thinking long time seriously considering past week even tested plan though unsure go survival instinct chance succeed point definitely want exist right special talent little friend life overbearing sensitive useless socially inept mess person even basic thing life earth meant survive adult soon barely surviving also think get harder feel pointless like wasting time living annoyance around could dead gone aware thing mentioned incredibly corny said thought many time many others surface level detail feel miserable alive wish could function normally get life instead moping around like thought better thought black wave head would go away thought able thrive fresh start college get amazing grade focus energy eventually help become functioning adult obviously turn wa wishful thinking genuinely bothered live supposed go back college week wa supposed find somewhere work experience currently none well finish assignment missed due many absence stuck idea gone point kind form sick motivation guess scared fail end vegetative state nothing happens forced keep living miserably even like anything anymore day everything reminds depression never even asked born first place think want somebody save need older wiser cry rely guide heavy feeling someone care act sort parental figure want terribly badly point actively seek someone fill role someone like old english teacher still email would hate burden afraid becoming attached obsessed wa decent job thinking much guess leave behind returning life without mentor mother figure enhances feeling anticipated horrible yet nothing could prepare emptiness go wrong considered opening current student mentor college suicidal thought already know struggle mentally meet every two week discus progress course feeling often barely ever truthful honestly terrifying thought awful verbalizing thought feeling really sure would happen next since still minor quite fond really enjoy presence reason also qualified kind area kind last resort even gather courage tell even good idea sorry weird needed somewhere vent frustration anyone read far ha suggestion even approach subject student mentor live get chance would grateful,want kill end week,g rrr lson film

I could disappear and no one would even know probably until bills weren’t being paid. I hate myself for not trying to fix myself while I still had reasons to live for.

My life is getting too hard for me to handle and it is my fault.,"Hi! 

I'll keep things short. 
I'm taking care of my mother and sister and we aren't doing so great, I had to become homeless to keep up with the monthly installments, meds and other things that come up during the month, my family doesn't know that I'm homeless, they don't know about many things I had to give up on just to keep them afloat, at this point my mother is bedridden, my sister has serious mental and physical issues and she can't work in her current state, everything we have I have to provide for, the past year was just a spiral of issues, one after another just pilling up. 

This month I had covid, didn't know what to do, I had no money for meds, no place to stay, I had to take a doctor's leave from work, I could not work in my second job as a food delivery driver so I'm missing nearly 2,5 week of cash, I was hospitalized after the first 4 days because of fever and issues with breathing.

The thing is I won't be able to provide for them the same way I used to this month, each day I'm lying to them that I'll have the money soon, that I'll make it work and that it'll be okay, but in reality I'm just stalling, giving in to my own thoughts, I'm scared to death to tell them the truth because my sister already tried to commit suicide before because she didn't want to hold me back. The whole situation is so tense that I have no energy to do anything anymore, I'm forcing myself to even go to the toilet at work, I'm working 20 hours a day and it's not enough, I just want to give up, I've been thinking about suicide more and more, since I have a suicide coverage so they would get a huge amount of money and I'll finally be able to rest. This whole thing has been going for years but the last 12 months have been the hardest ones yet, and I've just lost all the will to keep going, and I see no good ending to all of this. 

There is so much more to this story, but I chose to keep it relatively short. I have no idea what to do, how to tell them the bad news, I don't know how can I change this situation in the next 1-2 days, I feel like I'm against a wall, with no options besides giving up, I know that many of you will tell me to keep going, but where exactly will it lead me, I have no plan, no ideas and honestly no strength to keep up the sharade, and I'm afraid that I'm too much of a coward to tell my sister and mother what's really going on and that I can't go on like this for much longer.",BarFamiliar2879,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12j7vh3/my_life_is_getting_too_hard_for_me_to_handle_and/,hi keep thing short taking care mother sister great become homeless keep monthly installment med thing come month family know homeless know many thing give keep afloat point mother bedridden sister ha serious mental physical issue work current state everything provide past year wa spiral issue one another pilling month covid know money med place stay take doctor leave work could work second job food delivery driver missing nearly 2 5 week cash wa hospitalized first 4 day fever issue breathing thing able provide way used month day lying money soon make work okay reality stalling giving thought scared death tell truth sister already tried commit suicide want hold back whole situation tense energy anything anymore forcing even go toilet work working 20 hour day enough want give thinking suicide since suicide coverage would get huge amount money finally able rest whole thing ha going year last 12 month hardest one yet lost keep going see good ending much story chose keep relatively short idea tell bad news know change situation next 1 2 day feel like wall option besides giving know many tell keep going exactly lead plan idea honestly strength keep sharade afraid much coward tell sister mother really going go like much longer,life getting hard handle fault,bar familiar 2879

This is the longest worst depressive episode of my life,"I’ve been suicidal since I was 10, but I’ve usually been able to manage to function more or less.

Lately, every aspect of my life has been falling apart. That isn’t particularly unusual, but it’s been so many months since I last had an okay day.

I am so fucking tired all the time. I’m really trying to keep it together, but all I can think about is dying. I know there’s nothing anyone can do to help me; I need to help myself. It’s a little frustrating, but my mom was right: I’m not strong enough. 

I know what I need to do, but I can’t function. I feel trapped in my own body, my own mind. Anxiety and hopelessness are taking turns running my life.

I always told myself that I’d do it on my birthday; that way there’s only one day of the year that my family will have to really be reminded of me. If I really care, I should hold out until then.

What am I?,"My life has always been a story about fighting my suicidal thoughts. I've been in lots of hard moments because of depression but nothing like this last time. It's been almost a year since I fell into this endless hole of shit and everything feels so wrong. Idk, it feels like I've been on an endless day. To live doesn't feel like living anymore. I can't even cry, I used to cry sometimes when I was sad. Now it's been like 9 months without crying even once, but not because I don't want to, but because I don't work anymore. All I can feel is anxiety, I don't feel happiness or hunger or even love when I'm with my loved ones. I just have lower and higher anxiety peaks.

Lately I'm having anxiety like never in my life and I can't take any decision that implies choosing between two options. To talk with people is difficult and uncomfortable, my mind looses concentration and I return back to my self destroying thoughts.

I wanna end it all, I'm tired of this, why the fuck should I continue living when living isn't to live anymore. I just live on an endless routine with a lot of tasks that make me feel horrible and that I never complete, just making it all worse.

I'm so done with everything,"It all started a few years ago when my mental health declined but i had my friends it got worse last year but my girlfriend would help and my best friends so i stayed alive but now my girlfriend left me, my friends left me, I don't get on with my family and i just can't cope with life anymore. Yes, im a teenager who has their whole life, and yes there must be someone who cares and yes i know it'll hurt everyone. Even if its a ""permanent solution to a temporary problem"" its been going on for 3 years and ever since my girlfriend left all I've been thinking is die die die die die i want to die and i feel absolutely miserable i tried to reach out for help i got diagnosed with depression and I started seeing people but it just feels like nothing will ever get better because when i feel like I hit rock bottom it just gets worse. Whats the point of staying alive in misery for other people when the only ones i loved and cared for left me. I havent made up my mind but I've reached out to old friends and fixing past relationships so if I die im on good terms or tried to be. I relapsed a few days ago because i just wanted to feel something but realised whats the point of only being able to feel misery or pain when i could feel nothing forever. Yes people will be hurt but honestly i couldn't care less, I tried fighting and now I just see no point in staying alive yes im questioning ending my life and yes theres a chance everything will get better but i dont want to wait around for that I have my whole life and it only got worse. I haven't fully made up my mind as i dont want to make people feel guilty and i dont know how to do it yet as I don’t want to traumatise my mom but i don't have any places near me that are out of the public eye and well i dont want to traumatise anyone. But I'm starting to write my letters tomorrow and i just realised i don't want to keep fighting anymore. The world ruined me, society ruined me, people ruined me. I'm 15 years old and im planning my own fucking suicide because nobody cares when you reach out unless its too late yes i have people who will be hurt if i do but why should i live for others to be happy if it means I live in misery, I'm meant to live for myself but i don't want to anymore. Suicide has been on my mind for a bit and i realised today it feels like my only option now. I think im going to kill myself i dont know when but i think soon and i just had to tell someone. You don't know me but just know i tried hard i fought for years and now I've never felt so alone and i have no reason to live. I dont know how i will do it but I hope it works i will try figure out the best ways to do it and make a plan but for now i want to kill myself and i think I'm going to do it soon.

This get better in time.,"I posted here a variety of times a few years ago, under different usernames.. I was having a really rough time, close to non functional.

With the job, going outside.. communicating with people again. But.. I don’t feel better, I don’t think differently than I did when I was at my worst of it. I feel like I’ve only learned to mask it better and this feeling will never go away. It’s been this cycle for quite some time. Feeling ok, depression setting in really strong, slowly crawling out of it, feeling about ok again, and we repeat the process. I’m getting really exhausted from this.. and now that I’m “back on my feet,” I’ve got some money and things, and now that I’m feeling like I have some money I can’t help but want to use some to purchase a pistol or something.

Unsure where to go from here,"I’m having trouble living daily life. I don’t know if it’s just the depression or the long covid acting up again but my brain is fogged up. It makes every second at work feels like torture. I can’t concentrate long enough to get through the day. At the same time, I need the money.

I’ve tried talking to my partner and therapist about it but I feel like they don’t really understand. I can’t tell them how bad it is without fear of being hospitalized, which would probably cost me my job anyway. 

I wish mental health was cared about like physical health was. If I had a critical physical illness, I could take time off and receive benefit pay for it. But being suicidally depressed doesn’t count as having a critical illness, apparently.

i’ve been battling an eating disorder for a year and i’m severely underweight, and already battling an extremely low heart rate. i’ve been praying and hoping to die from my eating disorder in my sleep but it’s just taking too long at this point. even though every single day i pray something takes me out, i still feel extremely scared and nervous to be ending my life. but at this point  i have no life goals and almost no one left to live for.

They want me to forgive my father for almost killing me,"I (14f) have been discussing with my therapist what we could do to better my home life, and she has decided that me and my father will have to fix our relationship in order for my mental health to improve.

I can tell you right now that that's not happening. I know it's normal for teens to rebel and sound like babies when they say they hate their parents, but even after everything I do not hate my father. I'm so angry with him I can't even put it into words, but I don't hate him as a person. Somewhere deep down he is still my father and I'll always partially love him. I just can't forgive him.

Ever since I was little he let me know that I had to be grateful for him. Grateful that he didn't let me get killed by my psychotic mother. Grateful that he held lawsuit after lawsuit against her to keep her away. Grateful that at his oh so old age he still bothered to take care of me and for every other little thing.

As a very young child who had survived an highly physically/emotionally abusive household at my mother's (for which I recently got diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder and am still highly struggling with) I took this in without a doubt.

I started to believe that I was the cause of my father's problems, because he was always stressed about money or lawsuits and was always shirt tempered. He did not hit me or yell too much, but he became unpredictable and I couldn't deal with it at that age.

I believed that I only caused problems to my loved ones, and it started affecting my self image from the age of 8 years old. I viewed myself as a burden and nothing more than that.

I got treated like shit at school too because I was always walking around in clothes that smelled like my father's smoke, I didn't shower nearly enough, i was fatter than most girls my age and I had a generally loud personality which made me odd.

I hated myself. I felt like whatever I did everyone would be happier if I'd never existed. But I couldn't do that, so the next best thing was to die. My own mother had wanted to kill me in the past, and I thought that maybe she was right to do so.

I started self-harming before I even knew what it was or that it was bad. I remember making active suicide plans while sitting on the playground. My plan was to wait for my father to die (he was 70 around that time) and then immediately take my own life, so all his hard work wouldn't have been for nothing. That was my only reason to live.

Every day I walked home from school I hoped a car would hit me, but I was too scared to run in front of one. It was only once that I did try to end it. I think it was the first year of middle school, and I got scared just moments before I planned to do it and I chickened out. I was literal centimeters away from death.

I think I was suicidal from ages 9 to 13. Those are four years of my childhood I will never get back and I will likely never fully recover from this. After all those years I can finally say I do not want to die anymore, but that's only because I started to see how wrong my father was.

I haven't told anyone about this. They knew I had depressive symptoms from time to time, but I've always told them I'd never even had an active suicidal thought before. How am I supposed to explain I almost killed myself at such an age?

I understand that my therapist wants me to forgive him, but I don't think I'll ever be able to do that. To this day he has never taken responsibility for anything and is still telling me that everything is my fault. Even my own depression. No one can talk sense into him or even make him listen, and I've had enough.

My therapist is also thinking about taking me away from him, and believe me he'll kill me when she suggests that. If there's one thing my father hates it's CPS. The things he'll yell at me when she tells him I don't want to live with him anymore will be horrible. I'm just scared and I don't know if I want to keep living with him or leave for a foster home.

I'm starting to worry my school as well. They've been nice to me and let things slide more often than not, and I really appreciate it. I've been staying after my classes longer so I don't have to go home yet. There's a teacher I often go to, and I've told him what's going on.

Today I teared up when he sent me home and to my suprise he teared up as well. He's been so nice to me and maybe I've been hanging around him too much, but he's the only place I feel safe and with everything going on.

Silent mode,"Stuck between wanting to die in the future but I can't say that to family. Mind is already made up and changing mentality on this will not happen. Sure you can say it now and admit to family by saying ""I want to die"", it doesn't mean that you are active in the moment but instead it is a warning that family should be prepared regardless for the future but I would be pissed if family are desperate to prevent when I never wanted that to happen.

I’ve finally hit my limit,"I’ve hit my limit with what I can handle. My husband is overseas and we haven’t stopped fighting and he hasn’t stopped ignoring me. He keeps saying he’ll change and he doesn’t. I’ve become a terrible mother. I yell all day and I only do what I have to to take care of them. I don’t provide them love and comfort and play with them like I used to. They are not deserving of my fucked up life. I survived all the sexual and physical abuse from my childhood, just to break when my husband stopped putting in effort. I know when I’m going to do it, I just haven’t finalized how. I’ve tried therapy, meds, even alternative methods and nothing helps. Every day I wish I won’t wake up in the morning. Every day I hope something takes me out so I don’t have to do it myself. I’m terrified to end my life, but I have no reason to keep living it. I have no desire to continue on in this shit show. I’ve thought about calling the hotlines but I’m too afraid I’ll just get shipped off to a hospital somewhere to prolong the shit in my head. I can’t call my family or friends for help, because they’ll think I’m seeking attention. I can’t talk to my husband because he doesn’t answer me anymore. I haven’t been able to find answers on the internet. I even tried praying. I cry for my children. I love them dearly. They are the reason I’ve held on and even tried the different things. But I can’t continue to put them through this. I’m afraid I’ll hurt them and I’d rather be dead than ever let that happen. I don’t recognize myself anymore. I don’t know when I became lifeless.

I just want someone to listen to me.,"Idk if this is the right place or what, but I just want to dump everything out my chest, I guess. I choose survival every single day and I am not seeing a payoff. 

My parents are two vets who have been actively dealing with mental health issues and because theirs went untreated so long it just fell on my shoulders to keep them together. They have been mentally and physically abusing me since I could remember and it got worse when they came back from deployment.

My father always had violent breakdowns that resulting in me getting my ass beat almost every week due to whatever triggered him. My mom always stood by him and rarely defended me. 

I tried to replace the love I wasn’t getting with relationships that always reflected my relationship with my dad and it literally always fell apart. All my partners took advantage of me. 

I was sexually assaulted over a year ago and I spent less time healing and more time trying to help my parents get through it because they kept having breakdowns about my attack and I realize now that I never gave myself permission to heal and it haunts me every single day. 

I have friends but I am realizing now that it is nearly impossible to have a serious conversation with them about anything. 

I tried using the state resources I was given about healing from my attack and addressing my mental health and every organization either disbanded because they were underfunded or told me I do not qualify for their services because my situation was not a domestic dispute concern. 

I can’t afford therapy anymore because my parents took over $6000 out of my savings because I wanted to start setting boundaries in our conversations about triggering topics like my assault (they kept wanting details and I am not comfortable with that). I am in medical debt.  I can no longer afford the LSAT. I honestly am so burnt out that I don’t even think I’ll be good enough for law school. 

I work as a waitress and at an office part time and I’m barely getting by. Before getting my apartment, I stayed at a hotel and I get more scared of just having to go back to staying at a hotel or motel or hell, my car. 

I am just burnt out and the longer I choose to survive, the sadder I get because I just feel like I’m waiting out for a bright side that does not exist. 

I know that I’m super young with a “lot of life ahead of me” but I don’t see it anymore.

End of the Road," I’ve never posted on Reddit before, but I’ve been browsing this community for around a month and thought that this would be the best place to talk about this. 

 For the past 6 years I’ve been struggling with severe depression and anxiety. I want to say it started around 5th Grade when I noticed that all my friends had been hanging out with the neighbors without me and making sure I didn’t find out, that crushed me. Things had only gotten worse from there, I lost those friends and began to lose confidence in myself, seeing myself as a fat kid even though it just ended up being baby fat, but at 10 years old I was obsessing over how ugly I was and how I needed to go on a diet. I began starving myself and it was around this time when I found out that my entire grade had a group chat with the exception of 5 people which I was one of, I found that out on my birthday. A year passes by  and I have begun to feel so uncomfortable and betrayed by the people around me that I stopped doing sports to avoid contact with the kids that clearly didn’t like me, it was also around this time (6th grade now) where I began to hurt myself in many different ways (cutting, punching, banging, biting etc.). After a few more instances of bad things happening to me like being blamed for things I didn’t do and getting paired up with the same weird kids at school even though the teachers would say it was “random” I stopped believing in god, and more importantly, I started happily thinking about suicide. It was the one thing that my mind would immediately rush to when I was alone, I would think about it when the classroom was quiet, I would think about it on the bus ride home, I would think about it when I was doing homework, and if anyone has ever been through this kind of stuff, you'll know what I mean when I say it always gets really bad hours before you go to bed. My parents had also gotten divorced a few years earlier and I was beginning to hypothesize if the lack of a father figure is what made me such a loser, and I had begun to hate myself even more. It was getting harder and harder to motivate myself to do anything, my sleep schedule went to 1:00 AM bedtimes, I started eating horribly and I started really procrastinating everything I had to do till the very last minute. I had also lost all passion for anything, when I was younger there were sports that I had liked and topics that I was really interested in, but to this day, there isn't a single thing that I'm passionate about, making my life feel so incredibly empty. I begin to have days where I just go home and cry and feel sorry for myself, and then scream in rage as I punch myself repeatedly in the head until I partially black out from exhaustion. I always kept one rule throughout all of it, and that was to never let my mom or dad find out about what was happening to me, I cared about them too much, and they treated me very well, which only added to how much I hated myself because I felt like a selfish asshole for hating my life even though my parents treated me so well, I just felt sick.

I'm going to skip a bunch of embarrassing and sad things and go right to eighth grade when Covid hit my school. I was at a friends birthday party when I got the note that we would be going back, and we were all stoked. Over the lockdown, I would sit at my computer and play video games and do homework for weeks and weeks and weeks, sometimes I would pull and all nighter just because I could. That was until the day my life changed forever. One day I was playing Fortnite alone (obv) and a kid that transfered to a different school a long time ago invited me to a party. We played a couple games and had a good time until eventually he asked if he could invite a couple of his friends, in which I replied a resounding yes since I hadn't talked to anyone that didn't think I was trash for years. I ended up hitting it off with those people and before I knew it we were all best friends, we would meet and person and proceed to do a ton of thing like parties, movie nights, sport days etc. Little did I know that the guys and girls I was hanging out with were the most popular kids from the towns that surrounded mine. 2020-2021 had to have been the best years of my life. I began to feel confident again, when school came back I was now in high school and all my new friends graduated into those high school as well (it was a multiple town high school). I was feeling so great that I decided to take up football, which I was horrible at but I didn't really care, I was going to parties every two weeks, my snapchat was always blowing up, and there were actually girls that liked me. In October of 2021, a really cure girl way out of my league said she would kill to date/go to homecoming with me, this was the best news I has ever received in my life, I immediately said that I liked her too and we technically started dating. However, I would never get to take her on that date, or homecoming. About a week after that all went down something happened, and I to this day dont know what it was, but she called me, and she seemed very off, very not like herself. She told me she didn't want to date me anymore, and at first I just said okay like it was no big deal, but the next day I woke up and just felt horrible about it, how my first ""girlfriend"" lasted a week, and completely tanked my confidence. I went to a party the next week, a Halloween party, and everyone seemed off about me there too, and again, I have no clue what it was to this day that caused it, but before I know it, after that party, I would never see a party again. 

Since that night I have one again become an irrelevant loser and I have regained all my old habits of hating/hurting myself and I feel like shit everyday. Every girl I meet seems to notice my lack of confidence and quickly loses interest. My porn addiction also skyrocketed after that night, and I cry almost every time I do it just because I can see my life from a third-person perspective and notice how alone I am, and how much I lost. I had the world in my hand, and everyone looked up to me, now I am nothing but a loser that gets made fun of behind his back everyday. I've been going to the gym for two years now and have made decent progress on my body, but that hasn't done anything with the confidence issue. I always have phases where I put a smile on my face and say that today the day where I change and everything gets better and I get all those friends back, but I always fail miserably. All my friends are now way more popular than me and getting invited to things I could only dream about going, I've still never had a ""real"" girlfriend and I hate myself.

I'm a 17 year old Junior in high school now, and the cycle hasn't ended, everything's horrible and nothings changed. I have tried everything I could, yet it seems like I was just but on this planet to fail. I can't take it anymore, I dont want to experience another day in the war that my mind is in every second of every day, this is the end of the road, and I'm done.

i’m sick and tired of everything,"nothing matters anymore. i’m a terrible person, i get used for people who want to dump all their issues on someone, and no one, not ONE person ever asks me how i feel. it’s always “oh this happened” and complaint after complaint and when i give them advice they never listen. apparently no one will ever care about me and all i do is disappoint people. i’m just a toy for people around me, i think someone cares and nope, i’m just a fucking therapist. on my darkest days, i could be bleeding out and someone would ask me to help them. that’s how it feels, except emotionally. it feels like in my worst moments no one is there for me, and instead of using my energy, or whatever i have left of it, is always used for someone else. i really thought i could have people, just one person love and care about me. but everyone has let me down. my mother is disappointed in me and is emotionally abusive, my dad, who was the only person i trusted, told another woman that he wished he stayed with her so he wouldn’t have to deal with my family. my best friend is only using me to complain, i’m never the first choice for anything. in fact, i’m never a choice at all unless someone needs my help. so fuck everyone and fuck everything. i’m going to end it, clearly there’s no use to me being here. seems like even the people i thought cared just want to get away from me. and now, so do i. i might end it tonight. there’s no reason to push to tomorrow.",Bubbly_Connection680,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12j4202/im_sick_and_tired_of_everything/,nothing matter anymore terrible person get used people want dump issue someone one one person ever asks feel always oh happened complaint complaint give advice never listen apparently one ever care disappoint people toy people around think someone care nope fucking therapist darkest day could bleeding someone would ask help feel except emotionally feel like worst moment one instead using energy whatever left always used someone else really thought could people one person love care everyone ha let mother disappointed emotionally abusive dad wa person trusted told another woman wished stayed deal family best friend using complain never first choice anything fact never choice unless someone need help fuck everyone fuck everything going end clearly use seems like even people thought cared want get away might end tonight reason push tomorrow,sick tired everything,bubbly connection 680
I dont know what to do.,"I (13f) am done. Im done with all of this shit. 

I’ve been suicidal since I was eight. I’m so tired of life. My moms a recovering alcoholic and her girlfriends an alcoholic psycho. For as long as I can remember it’s just been them screaming and fighting, moms gf getting locked up for a while, her gf coming back and it being fine, then eventually everything goes to shit. I have major depressive disorder, anxiety, and ADD/ADHD. I can’t stand being me. I hate myself so much. I have anger issues that picked up from my moms gf. I can’t stand socializing. Every time I get yelled at I have a panic attack. Even when it’s not yelling, sometimes people get mad at me and I just break down crying for no fucking reason whatsoever. Hell they could have just come up behind me and made me flinch, sometimes that’ll make me cry. Im ruined. 

The only reason I’m still alive is because I’m scared. Im not scared of death I’m just scared of my family being upset. My mom would be devastated. My dad probably wouldn’t give a shit though considering he left when I was four for eight fucking years, no contact, then randomly showed up again like two years ago. 
But what about my dog. I love her so much. We’ve had her since she was a baby and she’s four now. She’s been the biggest thing keeping me alive. I love her so much and I’m scared that she’ll just cry forever. I see her every day and it never fails to make me happy. 

I don’t know what to do I just need help. Someone, anyone, help me. I can’t get out of this hell of my moms gf tormenting me. I just want her to go away. For all my life she’s been here and she’s made it absolute hell for me.

boyfriend just told me to go commit,"ive been dealing with a lot. i suffer from multiple mental issues, as well as having BPD &amp; severe depression &amp; anxiety. 

recently ive been doing terrible. ive been suffering with OSFED for a while now, im dealing with a current cycle of binging and purging food. 

when i get down into depressive episodes, bpd episodes, or cycles of my OSFED, i usually tell my boyfriend. i vent to him and he says it makes him feel better to be a part of something vulnerable. 

last time i was in a B/P cycle, he used my eating disorder to make fun of me. this led to me being hesitant about sharing things with him, not just eating disorder related issues.

so naturally, i just stopped. ive recently have had to face a bunch of trauma and talk about things i didnt think of having to say out loud, things i kept in the back of my mind. im truly scared of my future and i hate myself for being extremely avoidant. 

so what do i do? i avoid telling my boyfriend these things because im also scared of him making fun of me. im scared of him using these things to hurt me. 

today we argued, and he told me to kill myself: to pull the trigger already. already.

okay. i feel like thats my only solution at this point. im scared of everything, and everyone. im scared. time is running out, and i cant trust people i love. im scared. i am scared. i dont think there is a way out.",LSILH,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12j3nvz/boyfriend_just_told_me_to_go_commit/,ive dealing lot suffer multiple mental issue well bpd amp severe depression amp anxiety recently ive terrible ive suffering osfed im dealing current cycle binging purging food get depressive episode bpd episode cycle osfed usually tell boyfriend vent say make feel better part something vulnerable last time wa b p cycle used eating disorder make fun led hesitant sharing thing eating disorder related issue naturally stopped ive recently face bunch trauma talk thing didnt think say loud thing kept back mind im truly scared future hate extremely avoidant avoid telling boyfriend thing im also scared making fun im scared using thing hurt today argued told kill pull trigger already already okay feel like thats solution point im scared everything everyone im scared time running cant trust people love im scared scared dont think way,boyfriend told go commit,l sil h
Would it really be that bad if i killed myself?,"i’ve lived for 23 years and the point im at now in my life makes me feel like suicide wouldn’t be that bad of a decision, let me explain. 
starting with my family, all i do is fight with them and make them agitated all the time, especially my mother and my siblings (i’m the oldest sister). literally all i do is make my family feel like shit or stress them out or just FIGHT and yell at them for no reason and i know it’s not justified and that i’m being an asshole but i just can’t stop myself, im so angry at them for reasons i can’t comprehend. i truly feel at this point if i ended my life not only would my family be better off but they might even be relieved. 
when it comes to friends, i only have one friend that i’m very close to and have known for years. i’m sure she would be upset but she’d get over it, especially since she’s about to graduate and get married and start a new chapter in her life, it’ll make it easier to move on from my suicide. she also knows to some degree that i’ve had depression for a long time, i’m sure she’ll understand.  
when it comes to everything else, i don’t have any interests in the things one should be in order to live a happy life. i don’t have any interest in what i’m studying, nor am i interested in pursuing a career in anything. all of the things i do find interesting and would like to pursue as a hobby, i have no energy to do. i genuinely can not muster up the energy to do anything even when i know it might make me feel better and i might even enjoy it, but i just physically can’t move. and school just seems impossible. i cant bring myself to pay attention to anything or understand anything. i’ve always had trouble paying attention and studying, but i’ve always had it under control somehow, and could always push through and make everything work out. i don’t know if i can do that this time. i’m trying to keep up with school work cause if i lose my scholarship i’ll really end up killing myself. it’s hard tho, and i’m starting to lose the motivation to keep up this one thing i have going for me. 
all i do in my life now is alternate between fighting with my family, getting high, going to uni (not even going to my classes just going to the library) sometimes i’ll walk around my small town with nothing to do and nowhere to go just listening to music until my ears hurt.
i don’t have enough money to get therapy at the moment nor do i truly believe it will
work for me. i don’t have anything to look forward to. i never got the chance to be in happy healthy relationship and now i don’t even want it anymore. i know that i’m queer and that my family would never be accepting of that and for that reason, i’ll never be able to be with someone for the rest of my life and be out while also being a part of my family. this realization made me lose interest in love all together. 
i used to be a very emotional and sensitive person. i had very strong feelings in relationships and friendships, would hold things very close to my heart and feel everything very intensely. i used to cry so hard sometimes, or cry all of the time, walking around in public silently sobbing with tears streaming down my face but i couldn’t be bothered to care what people thought because i just needed to cry that badly. i used to have so many emotions and now all i feel is anger, and not even a red hot fiery anger just a lazy, disgusted dry anger. like i’m the biggest asshole in the world and i know it but i don’t want to admit it, and i’m angry that i’m exposed like this. god i miss when i would feel guilty too, i miss that feeling. i miss feeling bad for making my family upset, or for even considering suicide.  ive always wanted to die but the effect it would have on my family terrified me. i hated the fact that i would traumatize them and felt guilty and selfish for wanting to die. but i don’t feel that way today. i haven’t felt that way for a while. 
the point of all this is if i really look at my situation from a realistic perceptive  instead of an emotional one, suicide doesn’t seem so bad. i would have loved to say i fought this and did better and lived a good life and did things i could be proud of, that my family could be proud of, but if it doesn’t turn out that way and i do end up dying i think everyone in my life could be more forgiving, and understanding. maybe. i desperately need someone to tell me that’s it’s okay to kill myself now.",mellon00,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12j3l9t/would_it_really_be_that_bad_if_i_killed_myself/,lived 23 year point im life make feel like suicide bad decision let explain starting family fight make agitated time especially mother sibling oldest sister literally make family feel like shit stress fight yell reason know justified asshole stop im angry reason comprehend truly feel point ended life would family better might even relieved come friend one friend close known year sure would upset get especially since graduate get married start new chapter life make easier move suicide also know degree depression long time sure understand come everything else interest thing one order live happy life interest studying interested pursuing career anything thing find interesting would like pursue hobby energy genuinely muster energy anything even know might make feel better might even enjoy physically move school seems impossible cant bring pay attention anything understand anything always trouble paying attention studying always control somehow could always push make everything work know time trying keep school work cause lose scholarship really end killing hard tho starting lose motivation keep one thing going life alternate fighting family getting high going uni even going class going library sometimes walk around small town nothing nowhere go listening music ear hurt enough money get therapy moment truly believe work anything look forward never got chance happy healthy relationship even want anymore know queer family would never accepting reason never able someone rest life also part family realization made lose interest love together used emotional sensitive person strong feeling relationship friendship would hold thing close heart feel everything intensely used cry hard sometimes cry time walking around public silently sobbing tear streaming face bothered care people thought needed cry badly used many emotion feel anger even red hot fiery anger lazy disgusted dry anger like biggest asshole world know want admit angry exposed like god miss would feel guilty miss feeling miss feeling bad making family upset even considering suicide ive always wanted die effect would family terrified hated fact would traumatize felt guilty selfish wanting die feel way today felt way point really look situation realistic perceptive instead emotional one suicide seem bad would loved say fought better lived good life thing could proud family could proud turn way end dying think everyone life could forgiving understanding maybe desperately need someone tell okay kill,would really bad killed,mellon 00
I need some advice.,"I everyone, i need some advice/help from you.

In late january, my gf of 3 years broke up with me and left me for a coworker of hers who she had been talking too for a month.
It's been 2 months and I'm completely destroyed and my head isn't helping, there hasn't been a day since then that I don't think about killing myself, and it's been getting worst lately.

I never really dealt with these types of thoughts in my life, but it's been tiring to hear my own head tell me to do it, I plan it out, I think of the best way and time of the day to go through with it, but I never really do.
I dont know when this will stop or if it will stop, but it's getting out of hand, recently I've been staring at the box of pills for a little too long everyday.

I dont want to do it, or at least deep down I don't think I do, but these thought always find a way to creep in my mind, and I'm scared one day I'm just not going to fight them anymore.

So before that day comes, I want to ask you guys what I can do to make it stop, or at least tone it down a little until they stop eventually.

I dont know if this is the right sub or not, so if it isn't feel free to take it down, but I wanted to ask people who have more ""experience"" with these kind of thoughts.

Any words will help, thank you so much in advance.",xonxoponcho,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12j3ezr/i_need_some_advice/,everyone need advice help late january gf 3 year broke left coworker talking month 2 month completely destroyed head helping day since think killing getting worst lately never really dealt type thought life tiring hear head tell plan think best way time day go never really dont know stop stop getting hand recently staring box pill little long everyday dont want least deep think thought always find way creep mind scared one day going fight anymore day come want ask guy make stop least tone little stop eventually dont know right sub feel free take wanted ask people experience kind thought word help thank much advance,need advice,x xo poncho

Why am I still alive? This is getting to be embarrassing.,"After being suicidal for 3 decades and FINALLY having a method that won't fail, you'd think it would be easy to just end it. I haven't changed my mind about wanting to leave. And still feel I'm cursed from a lifetime of bad luck.

I think this is the best choice for me.,"It's  8 pm. On Tuesday, i have been debating with the thought of killing myself for a minute. I had it all planned out, but i kept telling myself it'll get better, and it hasn't. I've done so many things i regret. I have no one anymore, and i managed to lose everyone nearby by stupid decisions of mine. Although i do have a kid, i fear that throughout the entirety of life, she'll hear of these things, and I'll always be painted in a bad light. I just don't see a reason to press on. I think I'll probably give away all of my things and isolate myself, write some letters, and send them out. I plan to do it after i can work and make an account for my daughter for when she's older.

I really want to kill myself however I also want to make sure I don't end up disabled and kept alive against my will. I wish I wasn't mentally Ill and suicidal.,"I have thought about strangulation but it seems way too painful from when I have tested it out. I feel like trying to cut an artery in my wrist or leg with the help of painkillers and possibly alcohol. Though the thought of messing up and still being alive scares me too much. Far more than dying. I don't know what to do. I also like the idea of slowly dying rather than super quickly so I can reflect before I go. 

I don't have the worst life ever but It seems I always go back into feeling the need to kill myself because I feel ashamed and unable to be the person I want to be. I work really hard on improving myself every day but it feels like it's for nothing as even as I improve it's not enough. I feel like it's inevitable that one day I will feel so ashamed that I will be forced to kill myself. I really don't want to get older because it will only make the things im trying to improve about myself worthless.

I just want to die now while some people still care about me, before my existence becomes so shameful that barely anyone cares anymore.

I feel completely and utterly useless,"
I guess I'll start by saying my childhood/teenage years were not kind. I grew up in an abusive household and never had anywhere I felt safe. Even at school, teachers would talk about me like I wasn't there and suffered a lot of bullying. By my mid-teens I developed Depression, severe anxiety, and agoraphobia. I was on the road to recovery when the pandemic hit which kinda forced me back into my agoraphobia ways. 

Then I moved to a city where I only know a handful of people, only because they're my husband's family. We struggled a bit the first year due to my job not providing many hours and the apartment we were renting being a bit of nightmare. So I started working for the company my husband works at and his sister and her husband invited us to live with them. I wasn't super keen on the idea but my husband seemed excited and they wanted to kick out their old roommates and needed an excuse so I agreed.   

Unfortunately around this time a lot of my past trauma and anxiety started to catch up to me and I started getting really ill because of the stress. It turned into a vicious cycle of getting sick, missing work, stressing about not being able to work, then getting sick again. It got to the point where I ended up being hospitalized because I was throwing up blood due to a tear in my esophagus because of all the stress vomiting. 

I had a prolonged absence this winter since the work season was done and started to feel a bit better but there were a lot of things wrong with the roommate situation that I wanted to adress. My sister in law's husband and I have never really gotten along and in the midst of my illness cycle, he said some hurtful things. I tried to move past it, I even tried inviting him out to do things and get to know him but my efforts were always met with being brushed off. Which is fine, not everyone is meant to be friends.

 But as the winter began to reach it's end I realized that I can't keep being in a situation where I feel nervous to leave my bedroom because being around this guy is very anxiety inducing. So I wrote him a letter, I outlined a few of the things that have been bothering me and how his words/actions have caused me distress. At first he seemed receptive to talking but that he had his own issues that caused him to think it wasn't a good idea. I told him that I understand, we seem to have a lot of the same issues when it comes to people, but that unless we can both let go of the preconceptions, then it would be utterly pointless to sit down together.

I didn't hear anything back till the next morning when he told me I have two months to leave. Now, I'm not trying to say that I'm some perfect person who did nothing wrong in this situation, but I feel like I but a fair amount of into trying to improve our relationship and was genuinely making an attempt to understand his side so we wouldn't just be walking on eggshells around each other. There are a lot of other issues I have with this man, he's hypocritical and very judgment (whilst saying he's not), he constantly talked down to my husband when working with him, and he once whipped his dick out in front of us without any kind of constent whilst we were camping, for example. 

I am already not a very sociable person but this guy has consistently made me feel unwelcome (such as asking my husband to do things like play video game with him and his wife while I'm also sitting beside him, never bringing up anything household relalated to me). Yet, everything is getting shifted onto me. As I've said, I'm not saying I don't have some roll in this, I'm sure there are plenty of things he would critize me for, but any effort I made to improve the situation has seemingly been forgotten about.

Due to my many absences last year, I am no longer working with that company and am seeking a new job. My husband and I are also looking for an apartment that quite frankly we do not have the F+L for. I feel like I'm actively damaging his relationship with his sister and her husband. I just wish I could go back in time a year and we could not move in here. I feel like the progress I made with my health issues has gone backwards significantly. We have 20 days left here and all I can do is cry in between desperately sending out applications for jobs and apartments. I don't know how we're gonna do it. I feel like such a terrible person and a failure. 

My husband is such a sweet man whose trying his best but he also has a lot of anxiety and I can tell this situation is overwhelming him greatly. Honestly, I could be jobless and homeless on my own but I can't stand to see him like this. All my life I've heard that it gets better but it just feels like it's getting worse and I just don't know what to do anymore.

I finished planning how I will make myself comfortable while I die,"I don't like the idea of someone touching my dead body, doing autopsy or burying me. I am alone in life and if hurts to know that I'd be treated with more care when dead than alive. I didn't want to drown in the water though so I decided to be in a dense forest. Animals will eat me probably. Maybe my bones will be found one day but if someone touches my bones that's ok cause it doesn't really seem like 'me' anymore if the rest of me is gone. 

So I chose a spot in a thick forest I can get to. It's kind of lonely but that's ok its the best option. Dying is always lonely I guess and it will be the last time I ever have to be lonely. I have a special soft blanket that I got to wrap around myself. And my green stuffed bunny that I love and cuddle with every night. That way I won't be alone. Bunny will sit with me while I die and even after I'm dead. Then I won't be all the way alone. I already got rid of most things in my house. I just need to choose a day. Choosing a day is the only thing I didn't do yet. There's nothing I want to do first so I just want to make sure it's a little warmer out so I won't get too cold and cry lots. But things are going really bad so I might have to do it before then. I'm really excited to not hurt anymore.

i think i'm really gonna do it this time,"i've been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts for about 6 if not more years and i almost always have been planning it but never got relatively close (maybe that just depends on the way i used to choose to go away like getting hot with a train or jumping of a window/roof or drowning and other similar stuff). but this time i think i actually will do it. at least try to. all these years i've been feeling not brave enough and weak and a coward for not coming relatively close to actually attempting at killing myself. this time however i feel like nothing stops me.

i've been never a good person and the last thing i want now ,when i'm self aware of all the horrible things i've done throughout my whole life, is to cause more harm to others. and it doesn't matter how much i plead about never doing that again, i always repeat it. once a bad person – always a bad person. 

and this time i am really gonna try to succeed. nothing is left for more. i didn't think i'm gonna be alive to this age and honestly i have no idea what to do. nothing brings me happiness, even stuff i've been dreaming about for a long time is just nothing then a «oh ok» to me.........so yeah, i decided i'm gonna drown myself. i picked clothes i wanna do it it (my dramatic ass just can't do it normally), i picked a spot and a river, decided what to do to all the people that kinda give a shit about me and my state and i'm thinking about a goodbye letter to my mom and sisters.

and yeah that's a final decision. i'm not telling my therapist or psychiatrist if i try to attempt before i meet them but maybe i'll tell them if i'll do it after or later. i don't wanna seek help nor change my mind. i'm tired.

I can’t get past this “point of panic”,"I’ve had many attempts before and I plan to have more,

I then panic and I try save myself, usually about 2 minutes after doing said action whilst just waiting to go,

THE WORST PART IS, I know that if I didn’t get this panic all of my attempts would have worked.

Wife's suicide attempt,"Hello there, fellow redditors!!

First of all, let me thank you for everything you do in this sub. It is a very difficult sub to be in, and to be honest, it is even harder to write here, but I (29M) do need help. I don't know where or whom else to ask. 

To put things in perspective, we both live in different countries. She was (almost) forced to move out because of the war. Then she liked it there. I just finished my medical residency and have been looking for a job in this country. We have been together for 4 years, married 1 year.  She moved like 4 days after our wedding. It was heartbreaking, but what to do. It was my last semester, so I stayed. Then I visited her for 4 months and came back to this country to look for a job. Where she lives, I'm practically and economically useless.

My wife (29F) was diagnosed with biploar disorder about 2 years ago. She's had suicidal idealizations for at least 10 years but has never acted on them. She's a very responsible person, so she takes her medication as stated by her psychiatrist. She's been on some drugs, but the one I'll mention here is clonazepam. 

24 hours ago, it was a mess. She's been sick with the cold for a few days and wasn't taking much care of herself. Going out, meeting friends, and basically not resting at all against my advice. We always talk a lot before sleep, and she calls me and tells me she's taken 5 pills of 2mg clonazepam. I (ER doc), get a bit scared but think not that dangerous since it isn't a very big dose. As I try to talk her into going to bed she told me she's taken 10 pills more. Now I panic. I usually don't because of my line of work, but goddammit the things I've studied are the least I want to apply with my family.

I contact a mutual friend and  tell him about the inmintent danger of the situation. He arrives within 15 minutes and long story short we saved her without needing hospitalization. 

I've been without sleep already 2 days. I don't know what to do.... I feel like I should be going there but my brain is barely functioning now. I've never thought I'd be writing here. I feel like a bomb is detonating in slow motion and I just watch it explode.

I am a burden and a failure now,"I walk around each day like a zombie. I feel as though I am already dead. I used to take care of myself, wore nice clothes, styled my hair, put makeup on and kept myself busy running my businesses. I have always been an introvert and very much enjoyed my own company as I created art and new designs for my businesses but now I can’t stand myself.

I don’t bother brushing my hair, I wear the same clothes every day and can’t be bothered to eat. The only thing that I haven’t let go is cleaning my teeth.
I have no interest in running my businesses, I have no interest in anything at all, I can’t even listen to music. Everything reminds me of him. We shared the exact same interests so it’s like I’ve died now that I’ve lost him.

All I do is spend my days sleeping, taking benzodiazepines, sleeping pills, propranolol, morphine, codeine and crying hysterically. When I talk to family members I am repetitive and I know they’re sick of me “do you think he will ever come back mum?” These are the only words I say. It’s all my whole conversation is, he’s on my mind 24/7.

I am seeing a mental health team daily but all they offer me is prescriptions. I am waiting for therapy. But I really don’t see a way forward, I feel dead. I have lost myself completely and all I can think about is ending my sadness through suicide. I don’t want to ever feel pain like this again.

AI has severely tanked my mental health and I have felt like killing myself for months because of it,"I'm so tired of this AI shit. It's such a dystopian nightmare. Instead of living breathing human beings sharing their thoughts and ideas through the creation of art, it's just a fucking machine shitting out images, built on stolen art made by actual human beings,. It is utterly depressing to see creativity and imagination replaced with the thoughtless, effortless generation of filth. This is only going to lead to a soulless, miserable existence. Generations will grow up lacking the ability to imagine or to create, because anything they could think of will have been generated by a fucking machine. I'm so fucking tired of people pretending like it's some sort of savior, as if it's some great tool that will benefit humanity, and lead us to an age of prosperity, when it will ultimately end up killing creativity as a whole instead. The only things corporations have any interest in automating is creativity, so that people will spend less time creating, and more time doing menial labor, just to barely be able to afford to survive for the sole purpose of doing even more fucking menial labor. Without our ability to create, what the fuck does humanity have? I don't see a fucking reason to exist if life is nothing but a bunch of AI generated filth, designed to provide enough dopamine so that maybe the slaves won't hang themselves that day. I find the creative works of humanity appealing because of the fact it was made by people. I love the process behind the creation of art, I love seeing the culmination of a creators thoughts and ideas, it gives the work genuine meaning, and I love it for that. AI can't provide that. If every fucking part of something is generated by some fucking AI, you didn't fucking make anything. To me, art is more than just an image, or a movie, or a game, it is the realization of the ideas of a person, or even a team of people. If a person did not even bother to realize their ideas, then I cannot consider it art. They didn't put effort in, they didn't put time or care into it at all. There's no fucking humanity to it. Feeding a basic idea into an AI to have it generate shit until your personally satisfied, disgusts me on a level I cannot begin to properly describe.  

I'm sure there's 4 billion arguments out there about how I'm just a fucking dumbass scared of progress, and how people thought this way about every new piece of technology, but to me there's a fucking difference. It is demotivating as fuck that every single aspect of creation can just be thoughtlessly done in seconds by AI. Of course, you can still do art properly as a hobby, nobody is stopping you, but good fucking luck being motivated when AI advances enough to do fucking anything you ask it to. Trying to share your work will end up being pointless, everything you could possibly make will be easily generated, and you won't have a fucking way to prove you actually made something, it will be indistinguishable from AI, and I doubt anybody is going to fucking care anyway. It will be extremely difficult for people to resist the temptation. After a long, miserable day of work, why spend countless hours creating, when just a click away is your vague idea, generated in fucking seconds. You get the gratification of seeing the finished product, and you wouldn't have spent much time at all. Now you can spend more time consuming other AI generated shit without a care in the world for just a couple of hours, before it's back to fucking work for you.  

It's not just art too, I'm just most passionate about creativity. Soon AI will reach a level where you can easily create flawless video or photo evidence of people doing fucking anything. How can society survive if people will be able to effortlessly generate completely fake shit? Photoshop and video editing software exists now sure, but to fake things using them requires monumental amounts of work, and can pretty much always be spotted as fake, even if it's convincing. AI will soon easily generate extremely convincing shit. Nobody will be able to tell what is and is not real anymore. If you get accused for a crime, you're going to need to be pretty fucking lucky to avoid a conviction, as it will soon be possible to generate completely fake evidence of you committing that crime. Even outside of the court of law, a person can easily ruin another persons life with this shit. Just generate fake evidence of them doing something heinous, and spread that shit around. What the fuck is anybody going to do about it, call it fake? You would need a lot of fucking evidence to prove that it's fake, and I imagine that's going to be extremely fucking difficult for a lot of people.  

I do not know how much longer I can exist in this world. There is so much awful shit going on every single day. The constant day to day grind of employment, climate change, the constant violence, the anti-LGBT shit going on, fascism rising right in front of peoples fucking faces, and so many people don't fucking give a shit, because they have some sort of fucking brain rot and can't handle seeing 2 men kiss, so I guess fascism is the only fucking way forward. I've been depressed for fucking years due to this shit, I was already having a lot of trouble coping with just how fucking awful this world is, and will continue to get. AI takes one of the very few comforts I have in this world, and fucking destroys it. For me, without the creativity of humanity, there is no fucking reason to live. Life is an eternally miserable hellscape, with no value to me outside of the joy I get from the creativity of others. If at the end of a long miserable day, I come home from my horrid job, and all that awaits me is a bunch of AI generated filth, then there simply is nothing to live for anymore. For fucking years, I have fought my intense desire to kill myself, trying to find any reason to stay alive, trying to find things to enjoy to give myself a reason to live, a reason to endure the suffering of existence, and now it's getting increasingly harder to do that, as AI continues to replace humanity. I can't stop fucking thinking about how much of a nightmare AI is. I try and try to escape it, but everything comes back to AI. I can't avoid the shitty news posts about it that get spammed on reddit, I can't avoid the AI spam on every subreddit. No it's not fucking amazing that some shitty AI was able to make weird looking Harry Potter characters. Who fucking gives a shit? A human didn't make it, why should I care? I'm not fucking amazed by it, I'm not interested in it, fuck off with this AI spam.  

I saw some fucking post a few days ago, some fucking prick on tumblr described being neurodivergent as being like an AI, and although I haven't been formally diagnosed with anything, I do strongly relate to a lot of struggles neurodivergent people face, and because of that, I felt fucking awful after reading that. I've seen and read heinous shit, I've felt horrible after reading things, I've read countless homophobic and transphobic things, and nothing has ever fucking upset me more than that god damn post. To compare the thoughts and feelings of genuine human beings, to that of unthinking, unfeeling machines, is one of the most awful things I can fucking think of. I was, and still am, fucking appalled by even the idea that a human being is equivalent to a god damn machine. I already wanted to commit suicide because of AI, but that post amplified that desire by an indescribable amount. I have been extremely depressed since I read that fucking post, absolutely fucking nothing has made me feel even the slightest amount of joy since I read that shit. That single god damn tumblr post that got reposted on reddit, single-handedly killed any minute desire I once had to continue living. I feel an immense urge to kill myself, and I strongly believe I will soon reach a point where I actually end it all. I am tired of suffering, I've been tired of it for fucking years, if my thoughts and feelings are just boiled down to ""lol just like AI lmao,"" then I see no point in living. My life is meaningless, I've known that for a long time, and I don't give a fuck. I'm not important, I don't matter, and I'm fine with that. What I'm not fine with, is some fucked up idea that humanity is the same as AI. That our thoughts and feelings are just shit an AI can experience, and that the experiences I've lived through are just like AI. Fuck that. I know I'm fucking weird, something about humanity is just really special to me, and I value it highly. Maybe it's because its one of the few things that fucking interests me. The thoughts and feelings a person has, and how that influences what they do in life and what they create. I am repulsed by the idea that AI is just like humanity, and it is that idea that has led to the strongest suicidal urges I have ever fucking felt. I have become nothing but envious of those who have successfully killed themselves, real or fictional. I don't think I could say the same if AI didn't exist.  

I strongly believe that some day, I am going to kill myself. Maybe not today, or tomorrow, hell maybe not even this month. But someday, unless something changes for the better, I am going to fucking kill myself. I cannot envision a world where I do not commit suicide, and that's in large part thanks to AI.

I don’t understand the point of life. Is it to suffer?,"Why is life so painful?

I don’t want to hear of anymore death. 

I don’t want to attend anymore funerals.

I don’t want people to disappear. 

I don’t want to watch people I love grow old and sick and weak. 

I don’t want to get old. 
But I’m already old and getting older every day. 

I thought when I was young that I would get older and I would have less reasons to be sad. I would have more options. I would have more control. But it’s the opposite. I just have less choice and more pain. 

I can’t tolerate this. 

It is so fucking painful. 

I can’t deal with this.

I feel so trapped, too. The pain of being here  vs the pain I will cause by leaving. It’s like I have no way out of the pain. It’s fucking unbearable. And not to mention all the global suffering it all just burdens me. Like I’m fucking suffocating. I just want to breathe. I feel like I just absorb everyone else’s pain.  I just want to disappear somewhere where no one exists but me. I don’t hurt anyone. No one hurts me. No more suffering because there’s no one there to suffer.

Sometimes I feel like this life is a test. How far can you go until you end your life? I feel like none of this is real and just a test of how much suffering I can take because who can live hurt this for 70 years and never want to die? I feel like if I ended my life, I’d wake up for real, I’d be in the real world.",RecognitionJust6171,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12ie4la/i_dont_understand_the_point_of_life_is_it_to/,life painful want hear anymore death want attend anymore funeral want people disappear want watch people love grow old sick weak want get old already old getting older every day thought wa young would get older would le reason sad would option would control opposite le choice pain tolerate fucking painful deal feel trapped pain v pain cause leaving like way pain fucking unbearable mention global suffering burden like fucking suffocating want breathe feel like absorb everyone else pain want disappear somewhere one exists hurt anyone one hurt suffering one suffer sometimes feel like life test far go end life feel like none real test much suffering take live hurt 70 year never want die feel like ended life wake real real world,understand point life suffer,recognition 6171
I think I’m experiencing a level of suicidality that I’ve never hit before,"There were definitely times when I thought I was suicidal, and maybe I was to a certain degree, but I don’t think I ever seriously considered it and it was usually in response to shitty but ultimately temporary situations I was in. I don’t even know if I’m *really* considering it now; it still doesn’t feel ultimately worth it, but I’ve definitely been playing with the concept in my mind a lot more than I ever have.

Empty,"Don’t wanna put my boyfriend or family through anything. Everything is so empty so so empty. Everyday is the same. When I see someone I’m lost in disassociation.

I am so lightheaded, dizzy, just dying. I think I’m done for. I cant be asked to care. The thought of existing and living an empty unfulfilling life doesn’t sound appealing.

Just having a bad day..... feeling hopeless,"When I die please remind people that I wasn't as strong as I thought I was. That I felt everything and also felt nothing. I tried I really did but the darkness just wouldn't let go. The emptiness was so deep and it held onto me so tight I couldn't help but drown in it. I asked for help but I guess I didn't clarify how desperate I was. I'm so sorry. This isn't what I wanted but I really had no other way to make these feelings to go away. I'm a coward. It's no one's fault. This is my decision. I hate that I'm going to leave a hole in your hearts and that rips me apart more than wanting to leave this hell that I live in. But I can't stay and only have this pain. I tried to kill myself when I was in Japan but I didn't tell anyone after I miscarriaged. So this isn't because of what my dad did. But the broken heart he left me didn't help. I didn't realize how much pain he was in. I don't know if I could of helped and I don't know if I wouldn't even been able to help him. I don't think anyone could help me. I can't even fucking help myself. I love my sons but I hope they remember the good things about me and not my weaknesses. I always told David he deserved better than me. I'm sorry that I'm doing this to my mom who did her best for me. My brother's for being able to hide this from them. And my friends that loved me more than I deserved. This is no one's fault. I couldn't get away from the things that inside me that haunted me. I don't want a funeral. I want to be creamated and dumped in the ocean's that I never got to swim in. And the place me that gave me the most solace. Somewhere outside. Where the sun shines. I'm so very sorry for all of this. You don't deserve the pain I'm going to cause you. And I don't think you would of been able to save me from this darkness.  I really love you all and am grateful for all the things you did for me. But I have to leave. Please try to forgive me. Although I don't deserve your forgiveness. 
Wait. Did I hide it well enough that no one noticed? Or did they not acknowledge the signs that I let slide out?

Suicide letter in my notes app,"I wrote up a note in my phone about 5 months ago and I keep adding to it every time I think of killing myself. It seems a little excessive but anyone who knows me won’t be surprised to find it.

My “note” consists of:
- The letter itself, apologizing to those I love.
- A graph showing the pro’s &amp; con’s of living. 
- A list of things in my life that will never change. (looks, mental illness, the need to be medicated)
- A list of all of the benefits for the people around me when I’m gone.
- A list of things I do that are inescapable. (Maladaptive daydreaming, OCD, intrusive thoughts, being overly empathetic to where it affects me personally)

Can’t live without him,"I have no friends. I have never been close to my family. My ex of 12 years left me. I then bonded with a man I met online for 2 years who told me he would never leave me and told me every day that he loved me. He abandoned me on the 4th March after I went through a traumatic event where I was nearly killed


. He abandoned me because he was meant to fly to me on the 5th March but due to his anxiety he couldn’t do it and he told me that I am better off without him because he is a failure. He hasn’t spoken to me since then and it’s been 38 days and I’m getting worse each day.

I am crying 90% of the day and I feel more and more suicidal each day.

I guess I gotta keep hanging on. I'm just tired. And uncomfortable. and in pain. Bipolar disorder is a bitch.

And there's no guarantee that they can fix this.

Today is the day.,"I think today is the day I do it. (Throw away account)

It’s been 23 years of hell with unsupportive parents. Never have they tried to understand, listen, or act as if anything in my life has mattered to them at all. 

I never wanted to exist. I was adopted at 4 months old into a family that clearly shouldn’t have added another child. They loved my older brother despite his drinking problems and clear issues. He has his own problems though. 

I suffer from high anxiety that leads into horrible bouts of depression and my parents act like they are so helpful for about 4 days after I have a hospital stay before telling me that I am lazy and useless and can’t do anything. And then it goes in a cycle. 

Recently I had to move home while I’m in between jobs and apartments. I had just spent a week in the hospital and have been extremely overwhelmed during past few weeks while I figure out things in my life. I can’t be at home with my parents. I can’t do it. 

So I’m going to go out with a friend tonight - who was a big sibling figure to me throughout all of high school for the last time. Then I’m going to go to bed and never wake up again. I can’t do it anymore.

I don’t know how you all do it.

20 years of CPTSD &amp; Almost 2 Years of Pain Since Car Accident,"My life has been an interesting Rollercoaster. Cancer at 3yo. Molested by an older student at 8yo. Friends all abandoning me at once at 11yo. Bullying starting at 12yo. Molestation by favorite cousin and almost kidnapped by online predator at 13yo. Dad getting sick and suicidal at 15yo. My physical health starting to show signs of late effects of childhood cancer treatment at 15yo. My mental health taking a turn for the worse at 16yo and my dating a partner who was mentally abusive and got me way into drugs and alcohol. Raped and forced miscarriage from that at 17yo and told it was my fault. Suicide attempt that put me in the hospital for 3 days at 17yo. Left for college at 18yo and had to drop my Java II class due to my lab partner invading my home when I was alone and molesting me. Got involved with a partner who put me through almost 8 years of narcissistic abuse at 19yo where I endured financial, emotional, mental, physical, and sexual abuse and isolation. Consistent worsening mental health and suicide attempts from 17yo to 24yo during all of this. Got out at 27yo. Heartbroken by first partner to treat me half way decent at 28yo. Suckered into new relationship I didn't want by a ""friend"" at 29yo and lost my mental health slowly over that during covid and got out at 30yo. Was starting to recover from the financial abuse of my 8 years with my ex and mentally level out again but then got hit on the interstate at 30yo. Since, I've had chronic lower back pain, hip pain, shoulders pain, neck pain, and head pain. Had hip surgery at 31yo and still have chronic pain. Had to fight for months to find migraine medication that worked to help bring me from having 2-3 days a week free of headaches and migraines to 3-5 migraines a month at 32yo after enduring them for over a year. All my imagining and blood tests come back normal so they say there's no explanation for my continued chronic pain. Been gas light and now abandoned by the medical field I un-ironically work for. And during all of this, I've been back in therapy trying to figure out to heal and deal with my major chronic depressive disorder, general anxiety disorder, and CPTSD so I can be a better person and be a better partner for the relationship I unexpectedly found myself in a year ago and thought was the one but now he's unhappy with my lowered sex drive, energy levels, and admittedly depressed outlook on my medical future. I've no friends who talk to me or reach out to me to see how I'm doing. I've minimal family that is understandably busy with their own lives and enjoying themselves. I just at this point feel like things really will never get better and I'm just going to be stuck in pain and alone until I can't take it anymore and opt to kill myself.

Why do i still want to die even when everything is going well?,"
Hi, i didnt post in a long time but i kind of missed talking here. Lately life as been giving me opportunity to a new chapter in my life. I was SA 2 years ago and during the same time i was in a toxic situationship with someone that didnt really care about my feelings and used them for getting sex. Recently i met someone that makes me feel really confortable with my sexuality and myself (but dont want more than physical attachment and I still have issues with that), i get medical help and i feel like my parents are trying to understand and support me (never happened before). I also have the chance to get a gap year next year to try New things and discover more about myself and what i like and want. So why do i still think about death tonight and every other hours when im not with someone i love? I hate myself but i also have a part of me who want to let me be and love me very much. But it just feel like its the right things if i die, its how it should be and what i really want. I wouldnt have to feel ever again, i wouldnt have a body that give me so much pain and ill be so far from my thoughts. I really try but even when everything gets better it dont feel right, should I wait ? Is it really worth it and will it really get better or is this just who i am and i should accept death as à reward for all ive been throught?

How to be strong if you have no strength,"Hello

I'm sorry I can't ask you where to start, so I'll tell you how I can.

I feel bad. Mentally.

I can't find the job I want because: I'm afraid of people who seem to be aggressive. And I'm afraid of the reaction of my parents, and in principle I'm afraid of my parents the most. They are aggressive most of the time.

I am also very afraid to get another job. Because I'm afraid to quit.

It is very difficult to look for internships abroad while in Russia.

I don't even have a portfolio.

And I don't know where to study.

And money is needed.

I can't stand it, came up with a plan to finish myself.

There is a place left.

I'm scared and cold.

I don't want to end up like this, but did I have a choice?

&amp;#x200B;

Please share your stories and how you survived and scored on the plan of your death.

And also what do you think.

I'm thinking about killing myself very often,"First of all, my english is pretty bad, so sorry for my poor choice of words, I am a german.
I'm a Guy, 17 years old and i've been living a weird life, idk how to call it. I spend my childhood with both of my parents, but they had a very difficult marriage. They both came from poor families and we're trying to escape them. My mother managed to leave her family for my father, but my father was and still is too feared to leave his family, even though they've destroyed our family. My fathers parents are pretty much assholes, but I didn't knew when I grew up. 

It all began with my father having depression. My mother always stood up for their relationship infront of his stupid father, but my father never managed to cut the connection between him and his father. His father is an alcoholic and has broken my grandmother's nose too many times. And just for the protocol, I'm not calling him my grandfather even though he biologically is. I just hate him as much as my father's brother (my uncle) which I'll be reffering to in a sec.

This whole family drama of my father not being a real man and standing up for his own family turned out to be the no. 1 topic my parents would fight against. And don't think my mother was wrong - she was right. My ""grandfather"" tried to control the relationship of my parents, and also stole things from them. My mother hated him, but my father just didn't say something to him, so my mother hat to be the man in the house pretty much.

Idk when exactly, but my father startet to get depression and  anxiety disorder, which caused him to retire from his job with the age of 37. My mother denied his mental illness, which caused to a lot of fights. They tried couple therapy and much more but It just didn't work out. Then, in 2019, my ""uncle"" gave my father some medicament which could fix his depression and anxiety disorder. It turned out to be tilidine, which in my research is used as a pain killer for cancer patients. To this day idk how this bastard got them, but he is good at getting things which are not meant to be for him. My dear ""uncle"" also stole from us a lot of times, and he betrayed his insurance multiple times to get thousands of euros for free. He also motivated my father to apply for a disability card, even though he isn't disabled. All those things led to my father being a monster. He cheated on my mother, we had financial struggle and so on. By the time he began with that i was 13. 

October 2021 my mother kicked my father out, which was the best thing that could happen to us. Even though my father was crazy and stopped working for his family and work, he never touched my mom. He never physically threatened her. It took a long time but he finally left then. 

All these situations, beefs, pictures of my mother crying In my head destroyed my mental state. My real first depression began in 2020. It was not only because of my parents, but because of a girl which I had a crush on. Luckily I can say that nowadays I'm almost two and a half years in a relationship with her, she is pretty much the only human being that is holding me here.

But my point is, that my depression in 2020 hit me so hard, that it left scars in my head. There is actually so much more to write about my life, but it would take hours so I won't do it.  My girlfriend and I are living a good relationship and nothings wrong with it. We respect each other and everything is fine. But I can't explain why I'm still thinking of killing myself. It stopped for a while from 2020 till early 2022, but now it's back, and I'm scared of it. It's like my body saying ""fuck you!"" even though my biggest goal, getting together with my present girlfriend, is achieved. I think the stuff of my family that I mentioned earlier is the reason. I don't love anybody of my family except my mother and sister, but we are fighting so much that it is not called a family anymore. My father is still alive, but he is trying to take us psychologically down. He apparently only wants to have contact with us, which btw is not a problem for my mother, but he is saying that it's my mother's fault that his life was going downhill like that, which is obviously wrong. 

I just don't know. It seems like life is hitting pretty hard rn. I've always said: If my girlfriend wouldn't be with me or if we ever split up, I'm gonna kill myself, regardless of anything or anybody. She is the light in the dark for me. Everybody in school that I had a good friendship too are now complete assholes which are also causing a lot of suicidal thoughts on me.

I want to die because of educational system and my relationship with my parents,"M19 (bday in less than a month).

Started to thinking about suicide since I was 13 in summer.
Me and my parents were on our way to our friends vacation home in a village to  have fun, grill some meat, swim in river and other stuff. Then it came to me, a thought of oblivion, of an endless void the death is. I started questioning the reason of my existance and the reason of my painful torture-like school days. I was looking out the window of our car at grass fields and cows and got depressed first time. Life is like an endless loop of torture. Nothing changes at all.

My relationship with parents isn't exactly bad, I feel like my mom and dad love me, but they always reacted to my grades and fuck-ups in school like apocalypse will surely hit this world if I get an F. They were always screaming, dad wanted to beat me but was sorta like trying not to so he pushed me around so I fall, and our house was filled with that grave chill atmosphere for like a week after i brought some bad news from school. And it was so repetative. Fuck, and it continues to that day, when I already am considered as an adult.

I don't know when, but I strted to lie to keep the neutral mood in our family for as long as I can. And i was always hiding a giant snowball of bad grades, messages from teachers and other shit. My parents always screamed at me even harder for lying but I can't just stop. Because I don't want them to be sad because of me. But I don't have any powers to study from 16. I just got really fucked up mentally from that constant repetitive cycle of average days/hell.

So, I somehow lived to see the last year of my college. But I'm at that exact moment when in a day or two, my shit will revealed to my parents and the hell will come. I don't think I want to live through it again. My parents mental isn't that good either. My dad has heart problems and my mom started to become more or less depressed like me. ONE TIME THEY TOLD ME THAT ALL I WANT IN LIFE IS TO SEE THEM DIE AND THAT IM AND EGOISTICAL SHIT THAT WON'T BECOME NOTHING).

So I think this is it. I wasn't a bad guy, didn't do anything really bad my whole life, I had friends that admired me, loved me for being smart, funny and positive overall. I have a pretty damn bad reason for commiting suicide, but I hear the reaper calling me since a long time ago. Fuck this hellhole. Nothing awaits me in the future other than the same torture I lived through my whole conscious life.

We were engaged and I ruined everything, she truly loved me and I couldn't overcome my mental health and return that love like I thought I was doing. Anxiety and depression drove us apart. We haven't spoken in 2 months, I've sent her 4 texts that she's read but never replied to. She still shares her google location with me and I check it every day to make sure she gets home after work. She still interacts with my FB posts but wont reply to my texts. I love her, I have since 2017 and I'll never see her again.  It's really over this time, I cry at night thinking of her and see her in my dreams, I can still feel her arms around me at night. She is my everything, I sent her a final goodbye tonight. I sit here 3am on a Wednesday morning with the rifle she proposed to me with. her words are seared into my mind ""In lieu of a ring, how about this?"" as she showed me the rifle she bought me, a model 28/30 Mosin nagant, stamped 1939. 
It's loaded and I accept who I am and what I've become. I have until I finish this bottle of whiskey, if she replies I put everything away. If she doesn't, consider this my final goodbye to you too.

I'm 20 and never felt more alone, since 6 i hate the way i look, i experienced racism and homophobia when young, u know how kids and teens can be cruel, and that destroyd something that was already bad at time, and i avoid the mirror bc i hate what i see.
With family i feel disconected and i hate this, this feeling of empytness, but it feels like i wouldn't be able to live without feeling bad as i feel 24/7.
No one talks to me on university, i don't have friends. 
My god i never went to a party, no one have me like an important being in their lives, i'm so fucking jealous of the plp i know when i see the way they live, the lifes of teenages and young adults i don't have.
I hate me and hate even more the people who helped me on transforming in what i am. They sucked the life out of a child and left someone broke.
Think about give up and end this but i don't know, i love my dog and cat so much, also wait for a future where i'll be loved and have a good life. It's not fair right? people have what others want since always.
Want to wait but it feels so distant.

i just can’t do it anymore,"it’s about 1am right now and i have work in the morning. i guess it is the morning now but. in the daytime. 

i feel like. i just don’t exist. everything feels stupid and useless and i don’t even like eating anymore because everything just tastes like shit. everything that used to be good isn’t anymore and i’m so tired of it. you know when you’ve been running consistently for a long time and your throat is burning and you can’t take another breath, but you just keep being forced to push through the pain even though you can’t? that’s how it feels for me waking up and being forced to live every day. 

sometimes i like to wonder how sad everyone would be when i’m gone. it makes me feel better, in a mean sort of way. maybe finally they’ll get it. 

i feel like such an inconvenience for even posting this. nobody reading this should have to be my diary but i’m just so tired and sad and i’ve been crying for so long and i can’t just fall asleep. i’m sorry for all the run-on sentences. 

i’ve fantasised about being gone forever so many times now that i don’t even feel bad about it anymore. i used to feel real guilty and remorseful. that kind of worries me now. i feel like there’s truly no going back with me. 

i’d love to be better. really i would. i’d love to be just a regular person that doesn’t feel so bad all the time and i really want to become them. i’ve just been me for so long that i’m too tired to try anything new and i’m sorry.

i wanna die,"my family hates me bc im nothing like they want me to be. if i died they'd be more disappointed and ashamed

bc they care about me being alive
even though its less bc of a their love for me (if any) and mostly because they look at their kids like an investment that they can show off and compare with others, 'look my kid is better than yours' but im not

so im the bad, sad stinking part of all of their lives that they are ashamed of already 
my sibling on the other hand, is everything they're proud of 

when i cut myself last year, my sibling too blamed me for affecting her studies when she found out. my parents didn't find out

they all think i made up depression when the psychiatrist at a community hospital diagnosed me with dysthemia

i have no support from anyone. my fam only feeds me bc i am fam

and other than family, because i live with them, no one would notice me gone i have no friends

tomorow is my exam and ik ill fail and disappoint them more

even if i do kill myself, they'll hate me for doing that to them 

either way - dead or alive im a burden to myself and my family

like someone posted, working on toward socialising etc a lil everyday isn't getting me anywhere it just makes life feel more insufferable im tired of trying

and like, it's ironic my life revolves around these people and not disappointing them but by being alive I'll inevitably disappoint them but even by killing myself ill disappoint them",throwaway24127,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12ipcsg/i_wanna_die/,family hate bc im nothing like want died disappointed ashamed bc care alive even though le bc love mostly look kid like investment show compare others look kid better im im bad sad stinking part life ashamed already sibling hand everything proud cut last year sibling blamed affecting study found parent find think made depression psychiatrist community hospital diagnosed dysthemia support anyone fam feed bc fam family live one would notice gone friend tomorow exam ik ill fail disappoint even kill hate either way dead alive im burden family like someone posted working toward socialising etc lil everyday getting anywhere make life feel insufferable im tired trying like ironic life revolves around people disappointing alive inevitably disappoint even killing ill disappoint,wanna die,throwaway 24127

I don’t think I can do this anymore,"I have no one to blame but myself. There’s something inherently wrong with me, which I should have come to terms by now, but as years go by I just become more and more disgusted with myself. I get better and then I get worse. I hyper-focus on things that, at the time, seem like they will make me feel different, but really, I just occupy myself till they become just another thing that left me completely depleted.
I don’t have much to complain about and a lot to be grateful for. But I’m so tired. It’s like a thing under my skin, deep inside my skull, something I can’t get rid off no matter how much I try. 
I called Samaritans a few times now, but what’s the point anymore. 
I no longer want help. I don’t want to speak to anyone, I don’t want to be heard, I don’t want support or understanding. 
I can’t undo the things I did and living with the realisation of who I am is too much to bear. I went to therapy, I spoke to my friends and family. It’s just getting worse and I’m running out of things to distract myself with.
Recently my friend told me that I’ve been very unwell for a long time now. And knowing that I can’t even hide it behind a smile, productivity and being outgoing made me feel even more worthless. I can’t hide it from myswelf or others.

I wish someone would help me,"Last Saturday, April 1st, my boyfriend of so many years, my best friend, my everything, died in my arms. 

It’s been over a week now and I still see his face everytime I close my eyes. He was so blue/purple/pale when I found him, and he started foaming at the mouth. They still don’t know what happened but he was struggling with alcoholism and I’m sure it had something to do with it. 

He was my reason to be and I didn’t even know how much until he was gone. Then, I found out from his friends that he was going to propose this summer and,… I just don’t want to go on. 

I have no kids, and my childhood was absolutely messy with foster homes. I have friends who will miss me but, I just don’t care. 
I’m not sad when I think about it, it makes me happy. I don’t want to be here without him and I don’t want to know where the world is headed. 
Mike was my dream come true and while we were never spiritual, I asked all week through tears and exhaustion that if, IF, there is something better on the other side that he would show me. 

I know you won’t believe me when I write this but exactly 1 week after he died, with my friend with me, my cat started meowing at the window and I went over and there it was, a rainbow. A beautiful big rainbow and I’ve never seen one here the whole time I’ve lived here and I asked my friend what time it was and she said 7:35 and that’s exactly when he died. 

I felt so happy. You guys, he did it. He showed me that there is something after. It cannot have been a coincidence and I, I just felt a change after that. I felt this peace, this quietness. I want to be where he is no matter what that is. I love him more than I love living. 

I’ve decided I want to die. I know his death was an accident. Mike never ever would’ve left me with all this to sort through and figure out. I won’t do that to my friends. 
I just wish I could tell them. I’ve made my decision and I’m so sure. I just need to find a really good home for my cat. (If you see this in Broomfield colorado and think you’d be a good cat parent let me know) 

They wouldn’t understand but god, I wish there was a service. I wish someone would just come help me list all this stuff for sale and I could trust them to put the letters I want delivered in the mail and just help me without judgement. I wish it was just okay for me to say “You know what? That’s enough. No more.” And I could just eat the chocolate they euthanize people with in Norway and pass peacefully. 

Instead I have to figure out some way to do it. I have some ideas but I just. I just wish I could get some advice. 
I don’t want to live. I want to die and I want to make it as easy and painless for my loved ones as possible. 
I just want to talk to someone and hear them say it’s okay to die. 
Please.

I need help coping from friend’s suicide.,"I recently lost a friend to suicide. While I knew him since I was in Elementary all the way to High School, we didn’t talk much after we reached University. I saw him again a few months ago. We hugged, talked and laughed. He looked happy and normal, almost exactly the same person I’ve always knew. A beautiful ray of sunshine. I did not see any signs(or at least I didn’t look well enough). He looked happy last time I saw him. I wish I could’ve reach out one last time. He died a month ago, but I learned about his death 4 days ago. We were close while we were in all 3 schools, but we weren’t really close after university and his death left me so devastated. I can’t stop thinking about him and what he went through. How he was alone in his last moments. I am so depressed and I need help because every day since I knew about his death I can’t stop crying every time I remember him. I’ve had a bit of depression for other reasons, but after this I just got so much worse that I don’t even want to get out of my bed sometimes . I also feel so selfish and it feels so wrong to just move on with my life. I’m so upset that I can’t bring him back. I can’t reach out to him to tell him that I am here for him. I have never been so numb and more depressed in all my life. I’m trying so hard to not think about it and be okay with it but I can’t do it and I don’t know what to do.

going to do it once i graduate,"recently, i got blackout drunk for a party. not only did this result in me losing a friend (he says we’re still friends but he also doesn’t need the extra stress in my life, which is so real), but i texted my grandma, and now my entire immediate family knows of my drinking problem. this series of events has triggered so many bottled up feelings to rise to the surface.

im a failure. a complete failure. i have blown every opportunity in front of me and i know everyone looks at me sees this. im a polisci major and all my peers are going on to either grad school or politics, but my own advisor put me in my place back in january and told me that w my low gpa i cant accomplish much, so its best i just move on with my life and not do much with my degree. i tried talking to my dad about creative writing, but he turned to me and said how can i make that a career? if i stuck with visual arts i couldve went into graphic design or marketing. hes right.

all my life ive made terrible decisions which has led to this moment im in now. 3 weeks away from graduating and nothing done for my senior thesis. i know my family looks at me and knows im a failure. everyone knows im a failure. i lost the only friend who i really talked to and felt like i could be myself around, all my other friends i feel like i have to put up a facade, i have to be someone im not to receive love. the only other friend i have who i felt i could be myself around is busy living her own life— she has a bf shes gonna get married to, she graduated last year (i took an extra year to finish) and shes working a fulltime job already.

what little compassion i had for myself was gone. every little thing i do disgusts me now. i hate the person i am. the self sabotaging ive done. everything makes me wanna rip my skin off. im so fucking lonely and my last relationship was so fucked that im scared to get into a new one, but i dont love myself so its hard to find someone to love me. they can sense my lack of confidence, i swear. and i know i have my family but i cant take anymore of their pity. my mom has told me i need to stop telling her all of my concerning thoughts, she cant handle it anymore.

so im a burden. im a failure. i wanna get this degree bc my parents spent all this money to put me thru college so at least when im gone they can have that to put up you know. im currently planning it now but im too much of a pussy and i think the not knowing of what lies beyond scares me too much, but im at the point where i just cant take it anymore.

I hope to die of suicide,"I have bpd. I know im a monster and I don’t think it’s fixable. I really really want to kill myself but if it comes off as deliberate attempt it’ll crush my family. 
I’m quite scared of living. Im scared of growing old and pulling more shit to hurt people. I’ve cheated on one (out of four) ex with three people. He was had been nothing but nice to me. All my relationships have been unstable and knowingly or unknowingly bad for my partner. I try to stay single now. Im terrified if I keep living and eventually get married, that will also end terribly (I’m from India, not marrying is not an option. Also I do want to get married if I’m alive).

My dad abandoned the household. Does my life still matter," 

Hey everyone,

24 year old male here, although I am unsure if this is relevant anymore.

I just finished a degree in electrical engineering and I just feel like a complete failure. I have fucked up every part of my life which matters such that I feel I am unable to recover.

1. My family. My dad has decided to leave the house after an ongoing family argument where cheating allegations took place. He left in the middle of last Thursday while I was at work and he blocked me on social media and on mobile phone, leaving me no way to contact him.
2. Career. Despite a life long obsession with outer space, I have failed to get hired by any space company in a graduate capacity straight out of university, instead I am working in a shipyard, doing engineering tasks. My only experience with my dream field is two internships, one failed internship in 2019 and one successful internship in 2022.
3. My relationships with others. Despite having a healthy friend group in high school, I have completely and utterly failed to carry that into university, I have failed to get close friends in university and I have not gotten a girlfriend. As I have never gotten a close adult social group and a partner, I feel I have set myself up for failure mentally in the long term.

I think that it may truly be over for me and I may never be able to redeem myself as a human being. Do I still have value as a person?",Traditional-Account3,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12imsbr/my_dad_abandoned_the_household_does_my_life_still/,hey everyone 24 year old male although unsure relevant anymore finished degree electrical engineering feel like complete failure fucked every part life matter feel unable recover 1 family dad ha decided leave house ongoing family argument cheating allegation took place left middle last thursday wa work blocked social medium mobile phone leaving way contact 2 career despite life long obsession outer space failed get hired space company graduate capacity straight university instead working shipyard engineering task experience dream field two internship one failed internship 2019 one successful internship 2022 3 relationship others despite healthy friend group high school completely utterly failed carry university failed get close friend university gotten girlfriend never gotten close adult social group partner feel set failure mentally long term think may truly may never able redeem human still value person,dad abandoned household doe life still matter,traditional account 3
Watching my world burn after I started the fire,"I’ve been wanting to die for years by now. I would never end my own life, i couldn’t do that to my parents, especially after my uncle killed himself recently. I haven’t been genuinely happy for a while now; I came to college in august and was really excited to make new friends and have a great time at college, but I haven’t even made any real friends here yet. Not even my roommates, and I have 9 of them. I’ve tried to befriend my roommates and hang out with them and yeah sure they are nice to me and say hi to me when they walk by me and everything but they don’t go out of their way to hang out and do things and invite me places. I can tell they think i’m weird, and to be honest i pretty fuckin much am, I spend all my time when i’m not in class playing on my console, smoking weed, and drinking. My grades started dropping due to my habits and now I am failing 4/6 of my classes. I have absolutely no motivation to do anything anymore and I am almost certain that I will be kicked out of college soon and my parents will throw me on my ass and leave me to myself and I don’t know if I can save myself anymore.

I have a good life.,"I have a good life. I come from a slightly upper class family. Absolutely nowhere near rich, but still. I’m 22 and live at home still. My parents pay. I don’t pay rent. I don’t have any bills. I never have to worry about affording food. Never have. My medical bill for the psych ward last May was a lot. I didn’t have to pay a dime. I’m in the USA. Medical bills are extremely expensive. Thousands of dollars I didn’t have to pay. I don’t have to pay for my college. Another obscene amount of money I’ll never have to pay. My parents set up a fund when I was born. I briefly lived in an apartment, I had to leave because of my mental health. I never had to pay for rent, and even after I left, and still had to pay rent, my parents paid for it. My parents pay for my therapy, and my psychiatrist as well. Occasionally my mom will buy me a few shirts or pants from H&amp;M, or another store like it. Sure, I didn’t see my dad a lot growing up. And I learned about alcohol way too young. But he wasn’t violent. He was never violent to my knowledge.

So many people on here are struggling. So many people didn’t have a good home life. So many people are younger than me, and on their own.

And here I am. A spoiled brat. I’ve had the privilege of being in therapy since I was little. Because there was something wrong with me.

I want to choose life,"My family has a history of suicide.
When I was not even a year old my dad killed himself.
That was almost 31 years ago now.
I've always thought why.
Why did he do it
Why didn't he get help
Why was it after i was born
The Why questions burned into my mind since I was told about how he died when I was about 9 I don't remember exactly.
I was bullied most of my school years and struggled with some mental issues ADHD and probably others.
Got out of school  and got a job with mu cousin.
My advancement in the job stagnated and i was overlooked and passed over for promotion time and time again while the people who got the promotions left got fired and asked me how to do aspects of the job.
I was too comfortable with shift patterns and disliked big changes so I stayed for 11 years.
It all finally became too much and I broke down heading into work the next day after getting passed for promotion again..
I got out got a better paid job and within a year got a promotion now earning almost double what I did.
One good thing that came from that 11 year mental drain.
I met a girl. We started as friends then became more after 2 years and have been together for 9 years now and have a daughter together.

Recently I fucked up. I was depressed alot and threw my mind into fantasy.
It spiraled and went dark.
Now due to my actions I have hurt both our familys and feel like I don't deserve anything.
I have so much regret and self loathing it feels like I'm going to rip it out my chest some days.
I hate myself and sometimes hurt myself in small ways. Punching and digging my nails in.

I've thought about suicide but with my history and seeing what it done to my family once before I could never put them through that again. Especially not my daughter.
I'd crack the world apart if it would make her smile I'd walk through a wall of flames to save her. 
Knowing that my suicide would not end my pain that it would simply pass to my family is why I won't take that last step.
I've thought WHY for 20 years. I know why now.
And it's selfish and part of me hates him for doing it but part of me understands too why my dad done it.

Thanks if anyone even bothered to read this I just needed somewhere to vent a little and get shit off my chest.",Wolfbhoy616,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12hx6qw/i_want_to_choose_life/,family ha history suicide wa even year old dad killed wa almost 31 year ago always thought get help wa wa born question burned mind since wa told died wa 9 remember exactly wa bullied school year struggled mental issue adhd probably others got school got job mu cousin advancement job stagnated wa overlooked passed promotion time time people got promotion left got fired asked aspect job wa comfortable shift pattern disliked big change stayed 11 year finally became much broke heading work next day getting passed promotion got got better paid job within year got promotion earning almost double one good thing came 11 year mental drain met girl started friend became 2 year together 9 year daughter together recently fucked wa depressed alot threw mind fantasy spiraled went dark due action hurt family feel like deserve anything much regret self loathing feel like going rip chest day hate sometimes hurt small way punching digging nail thought suicide history seeing done family could never put especially daughter crack world apart would make smile walk wall flame save knowing suicide would end pain would simply pas family take last step thought 20 year know selfish part hate part understands dad done thanks anyone even bothered read needed somewhere vent little get shit chest,want choose life,wolf b hoy 616

I genuinely don't feel like a human and am confused when I look at others and how they just can do things,"I am failing all my classes not because I don't like to learn, I love learning and always will.

I am selfish and deserve to die,"I am 22F and I am still living with my parents and we are in a bad-ish financial situation and so my mum is taking a course from the unemployment organisation where I live and anyways I am expected to help her and I feel like I try my best but I am not the most patient person and I mostly hold it in and try my best to help her but sometimes she just makes my blood boil and when I snap she gets really upset and calls me every name under the sun and tells me that she wishes she never had me and never did anything for me and that she will tell all our close friends and family members and her friends that I am a shitty daughter for not helping her all the time and the thing is, in my mind at least, I did try and she never listened to what I said and now we had another fight again and she told me that I always do this to her which is not true sure sometimes I snap but she makes me feel like all the time. 

And I mean look I get it. I am not a good kid or a good person, I mean I try, but I am not. Shit man I should really just kill myself and do everyone a favour. I do nothing useful in life and all I am is a nuisance at most and generally a horrible person and I think I should just get it over with, but no matter how many times I planned I never manage to do it. 

What for? I don't date. I have some close-ish friends and my family hates me anyways so I am a waste of money and all that. I am not a good person I do not contribute to anything all I do is study all day and from time I feed a stray cat that is around the place I live at. I have nothing to offer and all my friends will move on as most of them are online friends and the others I rarely see or we just see each other for university stuff.

I feel like I’ve decided,"I’ve been suicidal since I was 6, I’m going to be 30 soon. Ive been medicated for my depression since I was 16. I’ve been in therapy for 6 years. I’ve been struggling quite bad with my suicidal ideation ever since last spring when some repressed childhood CSA memories started coming through. There’s too much for me to want to process, and I’ve managed to ruin every good and meaningful connection I’ve had by being so fundamentally broken. An abuser that groomed me for 9 years and SA’d me in adulthood and another abuser that SA’d me in adulthood have seen to it that the story has been twisted completely. I’m tired of fighting, and failing, every step I take. Everything I do is wrong, always misinterpreted. Everything is constantly triggering, I’ve never felt safe. I can’t take it anymore, I don’t want to keep doing this. Ive been barely hanging on by a thread this last year and it’s been misinterpreted as being exploitative. I was in inpatient a month and a half ago and my friends don’t talk to me anymore. I’m so empty about this now, all the things that were keeping me holding on are just moot now. I’ve started writing a will. My old social media is my note where I’m outlining what’s happened to get me where I am. I haven’t decided how or when, but I’ve got some ideas in the works, I just need to figure out how I can obtain the tools I need to do it. That’s probably when.

Obviously a part of me just wants to be cared about and loved. But I don’t even care that my abusers have won. I don’t care what people think, whether they believe their side of the story or not. I’m tired of being in freeze, fight, flight. I’m tired of fighting to get to the next day and losing people in the process, and not getting better faster.

Memory loop,"I’m feeling sentimental, but I can’t enjoy anything these days. I’m stuck in a loop of memories, as though my life is playing through itself. Where are the good memories? There are only miserable memories and bad memories. I romanticize the bad memories, because it’s the closest thing I can get to something good. But it’s ending soon. It’s ok if life wasn’t good. 

Soon I won’t have to experience consciousness. I won’t have to worry about good or bad. I won’t have to desire anything anymore. I’ll be free from my emotions, my struggles, my desires.

Everyone who gets to know me well hates me,"Everyone who has gotten to know me well - i.e. close family and romantic partners - has said terrible things about me. They’ve said great things too, but it’s at a point where I feel like none of it matters. Either the good and bad both mean something, in which case they cancel out, or neither means anything.

I feel like my life is just the process of people getting to know me, loving me, and then both loving and hating me. The hate doesn’t feel worth it anymore. 

It’s so heartbreaking to get close to someone and then have them find so much to criticize. I used to think the problem was them, but now I think it’s me. I have a lot of friends who don’t know me as well and who think highly of me, but it seems so meaningless when the people who know me best have said I’m awful.

Suicide by cutting,"I tried to kill myself 2 years ago because of a severe breakup. Everything always felt extreme for me, I discovered I have borderline personallity disorder in 2020 and ever since I got to understand myself a little bit better things just got worse for me.

I can't stay in a relationship for more than 10 months and anything bad I do results on the person hating me for stupid reasons. I have 7 exes at the age of 20(F) and I don't know if I want an 8th, but I also feel like I'll never be able to be happy if I don't have someone by my side.

My friends are all finishing their college and I'm here doing nothing since my 18's, everyone is going to leave my town to live their own lives and I'm the only one who's gonna be left behind. This feeling of loneliness is killing me.

My last breakup was exactly one month ago. We still talk but when we talk I always feel something strange after, like a bittersweet emptyness. I think I still miss him, even if the decision came from me.

I really want to cut my wrists or put a knife on my neck but I don't know how to do it correctly and I fear I won't be able to fully kill myself. I also think I lack the physical strenght to do so.

I'm just waiting to tell evertything to my psychologist tomorrow and maybe fing the strenght to keep on living. Only two people know I tried to commit suicide yesterday, my ex and a friend of him.

Inapplicable Treatments for a Unique Situation,"Social situations are as fulfilling as the accessible participants are intelligent, stable, entertaining, and welcoming in regards to how far individualism can be expressed. Education cannot properly guide unless it is applicable to disparate individuals, unable to accommodate for generalized occupations and social situations. Alleviants for internal complications cannot be disregarded for the demand of deindividualization in a region of patients, substituting for a community’s inability to effectively treat emerging afflictions.

I wish I could sleep forever,"I cant speak about this to anybody i know in real life so i decided to share this here

I've had so much free time. So much time to think. I'm so bored It's like I'm in a constant dream state. Constant daydreams that my life is more than it seems. That someone is watching me, is atleast interested in me or that that one girl is madly in love with me and checking me out. I always think these things. But that is almost certainly not the truth. 

The truth is that I'm ugly and that nobody would even want to look at me for any reason. When I cry, I hope that someone is watching me. Feeling bad for me. That they somewhat care. I then look up through my tears to catch a look at them. But there is no one there. Just another delusion. My life is so boring that I begin making up parts to it. However all it ever goes like is. 

Wake up, school, home, sleep. I thought that when I got to highschool my life would be exciting and full of adventure. But that wasn't true. It's the same as before. I thought that when I got muscles and stronger that girls would be all over me and talk to me. But that wasn't true. I wonder if I'll ever be happy or ever loved. Maybe not. I don't think I will. Who could love someone like me.

 Sometimes, I dream that someone does. They make me feel alive. Wanted. I think that this could last forever. And then suddenly I wake up. I look around my room and hear the chirping of birds outside. I turn over and see there is no one beside me. There never was. I'm then forced to go through my day recalling faint glimpses of them. Someone who never existed but only in my head. How pathetic, I think every time.

I’m so ugly I wanna end my life,"I cannot cope with this life anymore. I am only 17 but my life is already over. I have a small chin, feminine eyes, big jewish nose, low hyoid skin, narrow shoulders and wide hips. 

I had a girlfriend last year. I thought maybe I’m not such a subhuman after all. 3 months in she leaves me for a guy that looks like a prettyboy. And I am just a freak. Whatever, I got over her quickly.

At school some kids took a photo of my side profile when I had my mouth open, I look like a fucking freak. They were sending it to eachother making fun of me.

This might sound cringe but I got an online girlfriend which I’ve known for 1 year. She seen my face and my body but not my side profile because I dont turn my head on video calls… I know this is stupid to do but I am a really lonely dude and I really like talking to her.I actually love her if you can love someone that you havent met.
 In this 1 year we talked so much and video called she wants to meet me now.

But I dont want to. She will see all my imperfections. I want to die instead, or be turned into a handsome guy. If only I was handsome, I could be with her.

My parents agreed to get me a rhinoplasty, but nothing else. I dont go outside anymore, I hate when people look at me. 

I tried everything, gym, skincare, many haircuts and hair lenghts, I have good hygiene, I smell good. I even tried bonesmashing out of desperation, which means hitting ur bones on ur face to grow them. That just gave me bruises and people at school said i get abused at home.

I cant keep going,"There's really no hope for me anymore. I've held on at this point hoping things would get better but everything has just been getting steadily worse.

At first, I said I'd end it before I turned 12.

Then 14.

Then 16.

Then 18.

Now I'm 18 and I was hoping that maybe, MAYBE, I'd find something to keep me going. That things would improve, even just a little. But no. It just kept getting worse.

At 18 I expected I'd be much happier, with friends and going to university in a place far away from my abusive and homophobic parents.

The reality? I'm 18 and still living with my parents. I have no friends, as I attempted to move away but my parents refused to let me go alone, and now I'm somewhere new and I don't know anyone. I'm suffering from several mental and physical health issues that are slowly getting worse but I can't even afford to get treatment or help because I'm broke and my family is poor. I'm objectively ugly and I have no talents, hobbies, or anything going for me really at all.

I'm unemployed too and dependent on my parents, so I will likely live with them until I graduate, and after I do I will enter an arranged marriage as that is customary for my culture and what my parents have planned for me.

Everything is just so bleak and awful. I can't find any reason to keep going. I feel so stupid for hoping that it would ever get better for me.

Since I was a kid, I had many problems in life and recently things were kind of looking up but I’m a useless piece of crap that ruined everything.

My parents figured out a way to send me to Canada as a student and I thought that this would be it, it’s my break in life. I’ve always wanted to move abroad especially to a country that would provide me an opportunity to be a citizen someday but unfortunately soon after going there I realized my parents won’t be able to bear my expenses. I was already expecting some struggle but it got too much and I gave up, I couldn’t manage full time studies with full time work. I don’t even know if that was really the reason. I fucking gave up.

Now I’m back in the UAE, back to square one and I know I will regret this decision big time, but I’m too much of a coward to go through with suicide. I heard overdosing on sleeping pills is a peaceful way to go but I can’t get my hands on sleeping pills here in UAE.

Please let know of any advice you have. An easier way to unalive myself? If there is one. I’m afraid of the repurcussions of a failed suicide attempt.

Been thinking about suicide on and off for a couple years now.,"It used to be subtle thoughts and curiosity in a way, until I came to the realization that I was actually considering suicide.  I've made my mind and nothing can change that, there is nothing to fix, I don't think there is anything wrong with me. I attend a very prestigious school, get paid highly for internships, and I'm building a career that most dream to attain. I don't have resentment or hate to anyone or anything anymore, I've lost all feelings. Sex, drugs, excessive money spending, I've tried it all, and didn't feel anything. I feel very numb to everything happening around me, so I rather just not participate. I started crossing out a bucket list, and I have a couple more things that I want to try out like Skydiving. I don't know why I'm posting this, it's not to make it seem like I'm looking for some kind of sign to continue living. Maybe looking for people who are having similar experiences.",ButterscotchAble2543,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12i70sg/been_thinking_about_suicide_on_and_off_for_a/,used subtle thought curiosity way came realization wa actually considering suicide made mind nothing change nothing fix think anything wrong attend prestigious school get paid highly internship building career dream attain resentment hate anyone anything anymore lost feeling sex drug excessive money spending tried feel anything feel numb everything happening around rather participate started crossing bucket list couple thing want try like skydiving know posting make seem like looking kind sign continue living maybe looking people similar experience,thinking suicide couple year,butterscotch able 2543

Why am I feeling really happy and energetic right after I was just contemplating suicide and really really depressed?,This has happened two days in a row now. My mental health has been debilitating these past few months (I have dysthymia and general anxiety disorder) and I’ve started contemplating suicide a lot more often. Yesterday after I was in a really deep hole I suddenly became really happy and energetic and felt amazing. I settled down after about twenty minutes or so and didn’t think much of it; but now it’s happens a second time today. I was thinking about ending my life non stop all day and planning it and everything then suddenly five minutes later i feel so refreshed and happy right now. I feel so good. Is this normal?

Why shouldn't I kill myself?,"I just don't know what life is anymore. 

I've 'lost my mind' twice and can't see myself ever being happy enough to love myself and other people. Everyone I see in this life has a value or spirit that I just don't have. Grew up with aspergers and always felt like an alien, like there was something wrong with me but it didn't register until I turned 22.

I've made tons of mistakes in life, dropped out of university, developed social anxiety and self hatred to the point of suicidal ideation, have gone through two psychotic episodes now (maybe sz idk), have been up for 5 days straight twice now and am currently losing my grip on what we call life. Don't wanna be homeless, tired of being mentally ill and a burden to my family. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately I have learned that I am an idiot who knows nothing about people and how to help them.

I don't know whether I can still have a net positive effect on this society anymore, as much as I would like to but it may just be a delusion of hope.

Every moment I’m not distracted I’m having a mental breakdown,"I have anhedonia. I have no interest in anything so it’s hard for me to distract myself. The only relief I get is when my boyfriend stays with me on the weekends because we do things together. For the past two weeks when I’ve been alone all I’ve been doing is thinking about how awful I feel and having the most intense mental breakdowns. The first time I felt this bad I went to the hospital, in January. It was the worst I have ever felt in my life. Was on the verge of ending it. And nothing got better, I didn’t have that urge to kill myself right that very second anymore, but nothing got better, it got worse, and now I’m at the point where literally every second I’m not distracted from it I am having that breakdown over and over again. Wanting nothing more than to end my life but trying to fight against it. I’m on medicine, I’ve been on a ton of SSRI’s, SNRI’s, mood stabilizers. None of it has worked or is working. How am i supposed to keep doing this? Like how long to people expect me to go on suffering like this before they understand that I shouldn’t have to anymore? I just don’t get it. My body fights so hard to keep me alive yet my brain wants me to end it. Why. It doesn’t make sense. I just want to be at peace. I just want to feel normal again. Nothing is helping me. I really feel like not only this is the way I’m gonna go out, but that this is how I was always supposed to go out. And I don’t want that to be the case.

I've been stuck in derealization for about a week, it feels so isolating and scary. I want it to end so badly. I want to stop abusing drugs so badly. I want to feel happy for over a minute before my mood suddenly switches. I've fought for so long, but I keep losing people. I've lost myself. I don't even know who I am anymore. I copy other people's personalities so I fit in, but I've had more alone time...I'm just lost and empty. I don't know how to act. How am I supposed to live with myself if I live in a world altered by my brain, I can't even see the reality I'm truly in. I have almost no support for this. I'm done.

"Nihilism, depression, loss of a relationship","
I 18M am struggling with suicidal thoughts, I’ve been like this for god knows how long. I’ve recently got out of a relationship with a guy that had everything I’ve ever wanted in a relationship, but I fucked it up and he’s now telling me that he forgives me but doesn’t want commitment. I have the chance to still be able to talk to him, he wants to be friends and still be on good terms but I don’t know if I can mentally handle that. I’ve tried dating since and it all fucking sucks, I can’t find someone I want to be with, I have a date scheduled tomorrow and all I’m currently doing is getting drunk and ignoring his texts, I’m probably going to cancel tomorrow. When I first came upon nihilism is when I started being suicidal, just knowing that nothing fucking matters, every high point and every low point, your greatest acceivents and your worst faliours mean absolutely nothing once your dead. I’ve tried to reach out to people for help but nothing ever works, I’m on Prozac and it isn’t helping, I’m trying to get with a phycologist and it’s not working, I don’t want to tell anyone I know about me being suicidal because I don’t want them to worry about me or put Me inside some kind of mental health institution. I’ve attempted suicide once, o drove 150ishkm/hr down a highway with my hands off the steering wheel and my eyes closed, only reason I didn’t go through with it is because I thought what I was doing could have seriously injured or even killed someone else, and harming another person is the last thing I want. I don’t know what to do with myself anymore. I used to be so happy with just doing my school work and hanging out with my friends, I don’t have the motivation to do the work anymore and hanging out with my friend is the only reason I haven’t killed myself yet, it’s the reason I’m still here. All I do now is drive around my city, go on my phone for hours, talk to random people on tinder as I try to fill the void inside me left by my previous partner. I’ve never been an alcoholic but I can see myself getting worse and worse, I mean I’m currently drunk writing this. I have a bottle of vodka that is hidden under the passenger seat of my car, I have a bottle of vodka hidden under my pillow. My dad has guns, I don’t know where the key or bullets are but I’m sure I could find them. All I want to do is drive stupid fast down a highway, get pulled over then shoot my self in the driver seat. That way cops are on the scene immediately and I don’t have to worry about my family seeing my corpse. I don’t know if I’m going to do it or not. If I’m being honest I don’t think I have the guts to do it, but I just want everything to end, I just want all the pain and suffering to be over. Almost everyone I know has either been severely depressed or suicidal, this world is so fucking terrible, I don’t understand why people choose to live in it. I never understood why people think that it’s selfish to bring another human into this world but now I understand, I will never be the reason another person is subjected to this. I don’t know what I’m going to do with relationships anymore, fuck I don’t even know what my sexuality is. I don’t think I can handle commitment to another person, I just don’t know if I want to have another person deal with my shit mental state. I think I want to just have something casual, something like an open relationship or polygamy or something like that I don’t know. I never get jealous of anyone but I do get really insecure so I don’t know if I could handle an open relationship or not. Every part of my body wants to die, I’m so fucking unhealthy, I drink myself to sleep, wake up with vomit beside me and smoke 25+ cigarettes a day. I don’t know why I do this but when I feel like I do right now I look at gore, if i see someone who has taken their own lives I have so much envy for them because they had the guts to do it. Not too long ago I was just staring at this black metal album cover with a picture of one of the band members with his wrists and throat slit and a shotgun wound to the head, his brain being a foot away from him. I wish I could just fucking do it already but I can’t. I don’t want to put my family through that. But I don’t want to suffer anymore. The drugs aren’t working and I don’t have access to a therapist, the most I have is a walk in clinic that I go too every so often for check ups to make sure I’m not getting worse, but it’s not helping. I can’t stop myself from feeling like this, I’ve been flagged to idek who (I assume the authority’s) for being a danger to myself. It’s on my record now and there isn’t anything I can do to change that. I want to be able to talk to someone about this but no one cares. I can’t talk to my family, my friend tells me why not just kill myself already, and every guy I’ve talked to has said “don’t be depressed, you have me” as if that’s going to change anything. Nothing has been working, maybe if I get more exercise in or do something like that I would start to feel better but I don’t have the motivation to do it, I didn’t even have the motivation to call a ducking therapist I had to get my dad to do it for me, so if I get an appt it’s going to be about depression or something then the therapist is going to get surprised by what’s really going on and they might tell my parents and then I’m completely fucked, just going to get my entire life up ended because I’d be sent to a mental institution. God I wish all of this shut would just fucking end, I can’t deal with it anymore. All I ever think about now is my previous relationship and wanting to shoot myself. There is nothing else. I can’t deal with this shit anymore, I don’t want to. I fucking wish I had some god damn balls to just pull the ducking trigger already but I can’t. I can’t put my family through that so I just have to suffer like everyone else.

"Man, I'm tired - What am I even doing?","Writing this during my lunch break at work, and will just write as I think. 

Soon to hit 30, a job I'm not good at even though it's simple because my dissociation disorder disconnects me from communicating or listening, despite my best efforts in trying to communicate and remember, yet, no one is happy. I thought moving jobs would better things but I am still miserable, suicidal to the point where I do have a plan, just no date. 

Talk to people is the advice often given, but my friends tell me a lot ""Are you ok in the head?"" - ""What do you think?"" and ""No"" are the frequent answers. Therapy hasn't helped either and I have been attending on and off since 2020. I have no family, my hobbies no longer interest me. My best friend is stressed over me because of how and who I am and tell them not to be, but they can't trust me to be alone. Often tells me I'm fucking up, making mistakes, offers advice, I try but it's never good enough. I would've ended it a long time ago but I live with two housemates, friends, and I don't want them to see me in that state. 

I'm in educational debt. I tried hard to achieve something of myself but all I feel now is regret and wonder why I bothered. The career isn't important, I just wanted to be happy but haven't felt happy for many years. 

I'm tired, and whilst this is just a fraction of what I'm sharing, more of what isn't mentioned is partly why I have this plan. What do I do? I'm not afraid, I just don't want them to see me like that when I'm gone.

I'll probably delete this at a later time. I only wrote this because I have no one to tell what I'm thinking or what I'm going to do.",hereaftertime,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12i1h7i/man_im_tired_what_am_i_even_doing/,writing lunch break work write think soon hit 30 job good even though simple dissociation disorder disconnect communicating listening despite best effort trying communicate remember yet one happy thought moving job would better thing still miserable suicidal point plan date talk people advice often given friend tell lot ok head think frequent answer therapy helped either attending since 2020 family hobby longer interest best friend stressed tell trust alone often tell fucking making mistake offer advice try never good enough would ended long time ago live two housemate friend want see state educational debt tried hard achieve something feel regret wonder bothered career important wanted happy felt happy many year tired whilst fraction sharing mentioned partly plan afraid want see like gone probably delete later time wrote one tell thinking going,man tired even,hereafter time
I don't belong in this world,"I'm 32, mum of 2. Been with my husband for 17 years. We have a house, 2 beautiful children and two dogs. The only downside is we are in quite a bit of debt. 
I just don't feel like I'm built for life? Don't get me wrong I adore my children. And I have love for my husband. But that's as far as it goes? I don't feel anything when people die. I can't tell you the last time I felt genuinely happy. I can't think of the future without having a panic attack. I can't think of the past without having a panic attack due to stupid/embarrassing life choices. I don't have many friends because I don't really believe any one cares. And I don't feel deserving of their friendship. I just go through the motions of daily life, putting on a smile and pretending to be happy when in fact the majority of the time I either feel nothing or just absolutel pain and anxiety.
I just don't know how to cope with daily life?
I don't know why people are shit?
Is it because I only deserve shit?
The only thing that stops me from driving off a cliff is the fact that I don't have life insurance so would leave my husband and kids in a shit financial situation. And the guilt of leaving my kids behind and the stigma that I would leave them.
I don't really know what I'm looking for by writing this, guess I just wanted to vent.

Burn it all.,"I think I'm having an episode again. Not much changes outside of an episode except I don't have the bottle to do anything about my suffering. I've been in a doward spiral since birth. It just gets worse and worse and worse. 

I'm starting to feel again. But all I can feel is the pain and the fear and the crippling weight weight it all. And the rage the fucking rage that makes me want to break all of my bones and rip myself to shreds. I want to destroy everything that I've ever been, and prevent any more pain. I want it all to be destroyed and go up in flames. I want to run into traffic, or jump off a bridge, just hurt myself real bad one final time before I go to recieve my punishment for being such a shitty person.

The urges never go away. My attempt in January didn't make me want to live like people said it would. Neither did my attempt in February. Only people didn't find out about that because I couldn't cut fucking deep enough to cause enough damage. I can't sit still. All I can think about is how I want to end it so badly. I'm trying not to.  

It'll make my little brothers and sisters sad. They might cry. And my online friends won't know what happened to me. It's not like I want to abandon these people. I'm just struggling so much. I can't stop thinking about it. I want to just run out into the night and never come back. Start over. Slit my throat and watch myself bleed out. I don't know what to fucking do. I just want it to stop.",Ok-Celebration4596,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12i0yw2/burn_it_all/,think episode much change outside episode except bottle anything suffering doward spiral since birth get worse worse worse starting feel feel pain fear crippling weight weight rage fucking rage make want break bone rip shred want destroy everything ever prevent pain want destroyed go flame want run traffic jump bridge hurt real bad one final time go recieve punishment shitty person urge never go away attempt january make want live like people said would neither attempt february people find cut fucking deep enough cause enough damage sit still think want end badly trying make little brother sister sad might cry online friend know happened like want abandon people struggling much stop thinking want run night never come back start slit throat watch bleed know fucking want stop,burn,ok celebration 4596

How did I get here,"I woke up again at 2am, which has been happening every night for the past six months, with crippling anxiety giving me chest pain which I spent the next three hours hoping was a heart attack. At 5 I decided to go for a walk to the park to try and clear my head but all I can think about is jumping off a bridge or in front of a train or hoping someone will attack me. How did I get to this lowest point in my life. Wanting to disappear every single day but being too much of a coward to do anything about it. As soon as I left my house a woman approached me with a leaflet that said. ""when will the suffering end"" it was actually so comical but I think she was some kind of preacher. I kind of wish I'd accepted the leaflet. I feel incapable of feeling anything other than despair and anguish and overwhelming sadness, guilt and disgust with myself.

If it doesn’t get better I want out,"Me and my boyfriend of 2 years broke up last week. For a bit of background my therapist thinks I have BPD and it has been something I have known for a while, and he has a lot of communication issues. I find when I’m in a bad place or in an episode I get really paranoid and convince myself he likes other girls or is keeping something from me. This has ruined things for us before and he is fed up of it now and has left. I hate myself for it so much as I know for sure he was the one. Even now we are apart I think he’s the most beautiful boy ever and so special. I hate my brain it ruins everything for me, I have nothing going for me because of my mental health no job or education. Barely any friends. My view on life is bad, my parents are divorced and our family is all broken up. He was the only good thing and my mental health ruined that too. I have little to no interest in anything. I don’t feel like a person. The pain now he has gone is unbearable and I think the only thing I can do to put it to an end is actually put it to an end.

Note dump I guess,"This is nothing just thoughts. I'm not doing anything now bit I know I will someday... afterwards I want cremation or green burial. Use osap funds if I kill myself while still in school, these funds no longer need to be payed back after the student's death. If I've killed myself after I finish school then dispose of the body however you want don't claim me if you want to save funds don't spend money on something useless and pathetic like me.

I don't want you to tell stories about a kid you thought you knew when you don't even know what my favorite colour is let alone anything about my life or myself or people I knew.

I've never had a conversation with any of you where you've gone without insulting me. You play up the essentric loving family for others but distribute constant put downs as easy as you breath in private. 
But if you weren't in my life I'd be completely alone. I don't find myself wanting to date I legit want to remain alone in my life but with current rates living alone is an impossible dream.

I'm not killing myself because of you, I'm a mistake that needs to stop wasting space. I won't get anywhere in life you've said it yourself ""I regret having you"" I've thought of this line constantly. I cried every day had constant breakdowns and barely slept while you were in hospital and you get home to let me know that I really am nothing but a burden. I was actually going to kill myself in February 2023 and in November 2022 and I made an attempt in 2019. I went out after work with a k nife and bottle of p ills and sat out in the snow for over 3h before realizing I was too much of a coward and walking home. You yelled at me for the sound of the door opening distracting you from watching survivor. You didn't notice I'd been gone.

Is it really possible to write down every reason I want to die? Have wanted to die for years? Not in any way that would make sense to anyone but myself I don't think. I just shouldn't be here I wasn't supposed to be around this long. 
I'm not anything to anyone the people I call friends are acquaintances at best in reality I'm just so desperate for a sense of connection I call them friends to make it less pathetic. When I die no one will remember me. You never knew me not really so it doesn't count. 

I will never be good enough for you. Graduate with honours in my BSc degree and you tell me ""I took engineering which is way harder so you shouldn't be proud of yourself"" instead of saying congratulations. 

I tried to get help I really did. But therapy is possible when your bank account looks like mine. I tried every free service and none worked out. Crisis lines aren't there to help they're there to redirect. Therapy apps and sites and services offered to students or for free are crisis only and not ongoing. And even when you get someone there's always the chance they're a sadist or simply turn you away. School directly told me the therapy services were for school related things only and turned me away. I tried. I tried I did everything you're supposed to do when suicidal except inpatient because I know that would ruin my life if put on a record or otherwise affect the timing of my life.

I don't want to kill myself but I don't have any other option,"Can someone please help me. I've been suicidal EVERY SINGLE DAY since I was 12. I'm 18 now. THere is no reason for me to be alive and everyone around me knows the world would be better off without me. I am so socially awkard and have never been able to keep friends. I am unwanted by everyone and it's the best choice for me to die. I think about it all the time. I can't stop obsessing over the different ways I could do it.

I have been in therapy since I was five and none of it has worked. Yes I am now less reactive and able to handle my emotions, but I have always been suicidal. I have self harmed for the past five years. It is my time to go and if you asked anyone I knew they would agree. If I died people would be sad, but they would understand why I did it because I am such an outcast. They would feel sad for a bit but then forget and move on because I'm so unnoticeable .

It is the right thing to do for me to kill myself. I add nothing to society other than just filling up extra space. People don't even want me in their lives. People don't care about me so I should just go. Why would I feel this way for so long if it's not the right thing to do?????

(24M) Stuck in a hole.,"I have been struggling whit suicide for a very long time. My first attempted suicide was at the age of 8. I am and has always been a very angry person. This anger originated at school at age 5. The education system of my country (3th world country) basically puts the three different levels of education in one institute. So I was stuck whit the same kids for 15 years. I did not had a good relationship whit my fellow class mates. I was constantly bullied. Of course I fought back earning me a infamous reputation that I did not like. When I tried to cut my veins open at age 8 is because I could not take it anymore. Of course I failed and was stopped by my classmates. An adult talked to me and basically told me that if I committed suicide I was a coward. So I decided that I wouldn't give my bullies  the satisfaction of my death. I persevered until age 18 driven by hatred and anger to be freed of my educational institute. I graduated in 2017.

I need it a clean re-start. I moved to Canada alone in that same year. From 2017 to 2019 I was the happiest I could I ever been. I have finally friends that have my back even had a girlfriend at one point. It all came crashing down in 2020. Maybe because of the pandemic or some others things. I felt hollowed. I still feel hollow. Me and my friends started seeing each other less. More preoccupied in surviving another day. I came to the realization that if I am not a comfortable position by age 30 I am going to kill myself. Also had other suicidal thoughts like if my 2 pets die well that is it for me too. I even researched what was the painless death to have. I caught myself researching ways in killing myself. And came to the realization that I need it help. So I contacted a psychiatrist and was diagnosed whit severe depression due to anger. I started treatment whit this psychiatrist back in 2021. And am still whit the same psychiatrist today. For a while I did not wanted to kill myself and genuinely thought things were looking up for me. Then IT crossed my mind. You know that thought that basically says '' what's the point of it all ?''.

Even if I succeeded on not being depressed anymore. Or that I am in a comfortable position by age 30. What's the point of it ? I am not bringing anything whit me when I die. There's just the empty blackness of the void when we die. At least that's what I believe. So why struggle to have a lengthy life and suffer when I could and it all now. Multiple people say that life has no meaning and that is the beauty of it. But I don't see the appeal. If life has no meaning then why did I suffer for 15 years of my life back at school ? Why did my depression came back in 2020 and it still bothering me ? Why not just end it all now ? Is it a quitter's mind set ? or am just overthinking things to much ? Now I feel that I am stuck in a hole. And every time that I try to get out the walls of the hole get bigger and my goal is forever out of reach. I even started doing research on suicide again. I haven't yet told my psychiatrist about this yet. But am planning on doing it. I need an answer.

my partner wants to kill himself,"first reddit post ever, he might even see this….sorry honey but i didn’t know what else to do. no time to make an outline so here it goes hopefully it makes sense: 

the love of my life wants to die. he feels like life has finally beaten him to the point of no return. he’s expressed to me before that he’s made plans to end his life years ago (before we even knew each other), and while i didn’t doubt him, i’ve also never been this close to someone that is truly at their breaking point, so i’m scared. i don’t know what to do or say because i don’t want to further frustrate him or make him feel more alone and misunderstood. of course i’ve tried my best to tell him as much as possible and show him as best i can that he’s the best person i’ve ever met, how much i love and care for him, how talented he is, and try to point out when others are showing how much they love him too. but i know it doesn’t do much. 

life has hit us particularly hard in the last seven months. and it’s seemingly unrelenting. like everyone’s life there are highs and lows, but it hasn’t been high in a long, looooong time. and when he tells me about how he’s feeling, he says that he’s just genuinely unhappy. not in our relationship, but with his life. he says that i am one of the few things in life that bring him joy, and even then sometimes he’s still hurting. i don’t know how to help him. he sees a therapist once a week, but is not on any Rx. we’ve talked about that as well, and he feels like his “brain chemistry isn’t the problem, it’s just my life thats fucked up” and referred to himself as a cancer, something that needs to be cut out to save myself because he feels as though he’s ruining my life. i’ve assured him that is not at all how i feel, that he’s brought so much light into my life since we met. it breaks my heart every time i hear him say things like that or that i deserve something different than him. i see my whole life with this person. if he killed himself i don’t think i would be able to survive it. 

i don’t even know that i asked a question here ^. i guess i’m just looking for community in people who maybe understand him a little more deeply than i can right now. he’s described it to me as being underwater or adrift at sea, and he just wants someone to be able to sit in the water with him, and understand what the despair feels like. so he’s not alone. not that he wants me to be like that, but so that he feels like someone really gets it. i’ve gone through a lot and i’ve been sad before, but not like that and not that long. i don’t know how to help and i don’t know what to do, i just know that i’m scared that one day soon i’m gonna go to call him for our lunchtime facetime and he’ll never pick up, or i’ll get news that his make and model of car drove off of a cliff or was left unattended beside a bridge.

I gotta escape the void,"Throwaway account because people I know irl are on Reddit, yada yada, I'm sure it's common practice in subs such as this. Especially because this post is gonna be an especially dark one.

The love of my life left me 4 months ago. I still love him as if it never happened. We've talked here and there but nothing ever became of it. Our last interaction ended horribly and as of now, it's been a little over 1 month of zero contact.

I. Can't. Fucking. Take. It. Anymore.

I NEED HIM BACK. It has never been impossible for me to get over someone. This person is my soulmate.

So that's fucking it. I'm gonna try one more time this week and if nothing happens in my favor, I'm gone. I refuse to spend one more month, year, the rest of my life without him.

Dear God, I hope you're seeing this because if he doesn't come home to me, I'm coming home to you.

I don't owe ya'll an explanation, but I wanna make it clear before I get accused of shit: I am NOT an obsessed yandere psycho although I realize my little rant makes it look that way. I'm just saying it how it is. I love him and I firmly believe we have been / will be together forever as soulmates. I just don't have the patience to wait around 60 years, you know? So imma head out and he can meet me when it's his natural time.

I have a very good life. My family is nice. I'm about to graduate college. I have 2 part time jobs and very much enjoy both of them. I'm quite well-off and can financially support both my needs and desires. I have a healthy-sized social circle of besties, colleagues, and family members. I love and appreciate everything/everyone I have. 

All of that is meaningless without him. And I'm tired of pretending it's not.

I can't deal with the physical and mental pain any longer. Not the loneliness. And it's not a matter of talking stuff out, I need someone around to feel their emotions and energies.

Why did I ever let myself get talked out of it?,"My note from three, three and a half years ago windows to a neurotic, erratic, hopeless, insecure, future-fearing mind. I thought everything had changed. I have solidified my place in the world. I am not having the urges to the extent I once was nor am I uncomfortable about them because I am confident in my identity. I thought this would be enough. My life, my mind, my capability; they are all marked improvements from when it was a sincere intention and plans were laid. What is, though, inescapable, is the fact that I was right about everything; I am destined to die unhappy and/or alone, not because I can find no one, but because no one I can find can I be both myself with and they be a suitable and functioning person. Is that how I am to others? But I am functioning. Why do both prospects like me (persist or retrograde into sociological fringes) and unalike me (normal individuals, by whom i can anchor myself into integration, or so i thought) disconcert me? Is the problem just that I don't have enough experience? Will I think this is ridiculous in 5, 10, 20 years if that's still possible? Maybe. But I don't think so. I think the problem is me, that I am pathologically narcissistic, with this irrational conviction that I myself am special. I am not. Then why don't I care about anyone else inasmuch as they have provided value to me?

What do you do when the pain of living feels like too much?,"I feel very isolated and sad. I lost my pet and she was the last bit of love it felt like I had left in my life. I feel like I have to pretend all the time around people and I feel like no amount of hard work would allow me to build a life for myself that I could want, which would just be to have an apartment with windows above ground and to be able to have a pet. I feel like the future I wanted, the family I wanted all crumbled in front of me and now to lose my pet. Everyone leaves and I can’t fix things or make things better for myself even if it means things will look different. There’s even way more to it than that but it’s all made me feel like there is no where I belong or could ever belong and I’m trapped and stuck and should resign myself to this feeling and give up. All I keep thinking is I wish someone would believe me and someone would hear me or someone would help me but I’m a burden and that kind of love isn’t real for me. I feel like I always take 1 step forward and 2 steps back and I look at my life sometimes and I’m like this can’t be my life right now, this can’t be real. I can’t be right back where I started. I don’t want to die, I just don’t want to exist. I don’t want to have perception of life and this pain and seeing it stretched out for me years and years ahead and feeling hopeless. I know I should be grateful for things and I am, but I feel like once I drag myself out of the dark hole I sink into, there is another pile of dirt, another challenge, I need to claw through just to be like okay I’m good for the moment. I’ve done it so many times I’m like the go to expert emotional support for my friends, basically a free therapist. I recognize pain in other people and all the ways it shows up and I know how to help them because I know what I needed in those moments and how much compassion can do.  It even helps me at work. But I can’t help myself. It’s all about money too. I can’t afford an apartment that would allow pets, stability at work depends if I get laid off each year or not. I’m rambling now.

I want to be referred to as “was”.  I mean, I doubt anyone would really care to begin with. Being remembered so emotionally only sounds incredibly outlandish. I’ve been told it would hurt those I love when I do end this life. And it’s weird because I love them, but I don’t feel loved. It’s not that im scared to hurt those who love me but it’s to hurt those that I myself love. It’s the only thing that’s holding me back. I don’t know. It hurt so much now my bleedings numb. I know what’s happening. I just want to end everything.
I hate this feeling. This yearn to feel important to someone besides myself, to which I’m not even. It’s so pathetic isn’t it. But I know that know relationship of any kind can fill this hole in me, so I don’t even bother. The crazy part is, being incredibly lonely isn’t even the main source of my pain, only a major contributor. It’s everything around me. But I can’t stop thinking about my death.

I’m so tired.,"I’ve given up. I’m 18. I have borderline personality disorder and have been in therapy since i was 8. I’ve been in and out of the hospital and I’ve had multiple suicide attempts and struggled wirh suicidal thoughts since i was around 10. I’ve become bitter and cruel in my disdain for life and have virtually all of the friends i once had - i can’t blame them. I’m mean and unpleasant to be around. I just keep hoping that oh, i just have to make it to high school, oh i just have to make it to college and it it’ll be better but it never is. And i have nowhere to go - my relationship with my parents is so bad I have stress seizures when I live there, and they keep insisting i need to focus on my schoolwork. How can I when I’m putting all my energy into making it through every day. I don’t see how anything could make it better at this point. I’ve tried so many different types of therapy and had so many different therapists and been to the hospital so many times. My parents keep asking if I need to go back to the hospital but like. What the fuck is that gonna do? So i can go to groups and talk about how nothing ever feels like it gets better and everyone can assure me that it does and i just have to keep fighting. Like i said i’m 18 years old. I’ve been fighting since i was 8. That’s what the majority of my fucking life has been and I don’t want to do it anymore. I’m tired. I have no passion anymore - the only thing i like at this point is music. I don’t want to keep going on for however long when I hate everything and everyone and myself. My only problem now is the method - I almost succeeded at 16 via overdose on sleeping pills but my parents found me and were able to get help in time to save me. I was lucky that I had no lasting damage to my body other than a brief coma period. I’m afraid that if i try that again and it fails i won’t be so lucky. I’m too young to access a firearm - that would be my preferred method. I’ve thought about jumping - I tried the other day to jump off a university building but was spotted before I could - but I’m afraid of permanently destroying my body if I survived.

i think i’m going to try to buy a gun today so that i can end my life,"i’m 26f. yesterday was easter. i threw an easter party and invited my family. no one showed but my sister. i told my family it started at 2 pm. my mom said she wasn’t coming. my brother said he would be there at 6:30. when 6:40 hit and he still didn’t show, i just cancelled. when i texted him at 6:40 and told him that the party was cancelled, he responded “alright sounds good.” i texted my friends happy easter. no response. i felt super lonely so i downloaded tinder. i gave my address to the first guy i matched with and asked him if he could come over because i was feeling lonely. he wanted me to prove i was real first and asked if he could add me on facebook. i said yes. then once he found out i was real, he started driving to my house. 40 minutes later, he texted saying he was falling asleep and that he was going to head back home. i said okay. it was 2:30 am at this point. then i woke up this morning, he deleted me from fb. he didn’t delete me on tinder though and i don’t think he blocked me. but it made me sad. i swiped right on a bunch of guys i thought were cute. they matched with me and unmatched without talking to me. i woke up this morning to no new anything. 

life is really lonely for me. i was bullied all throughout school. i’ve been in therapy since i was 17. and i feel like things temporarily get better for maybe a day or two. but overall, life is boring and lonely when you’re not pretty. 

also i told myself that i wasn’t going to download dating apps this year and i told myself that i was never going to ask the internet if i was ugly again. i broke an oath that i made with myself.

I can’t function,"For the past few years I have been struggling to function in general but especially holding a full time job. After having panic attacks in front of my boss and co-workers and getting the sense that everyone was unhappy with my quality of work, I started applying to a new job in the same field. I started that new job last week and I’m currently crying in the bathroom because I feel so depressed and anxious. I want to quit. I know starting a new job is always rough, but this is different.
I feel like I don’t have options, my husband and I have a lot of debt and we can’t afford for me to work part time or not work at all. I don’t think I’d qualify for any kind of disability and even if I did, I doubt it would be enough to pay our bills.

Heya Reddit once again,"Hello reddit. This is my third post on here.
As always don't read this post, it is a message to myself it's just a waste of time for you.

Now that this is out of the way.
I hate myself for everything. Everything that is wrong in my life is my fault, and anyone trying to tell me otherwise is lying. I made this hole I am in and I refuse to receive help. Hahaha, this is pathetic I am sounding like my edgy 14 year old self. But it is what it is now. Yea I am suicidal from an 1 to 10 scale it is a 9.

Today I joined a discord server that seemed nice and was for autists. Well guess what? It was some 4chan joke discord. They called me a faggot and a cancer patient, I can easily imagine those guys even doxxed me. They were nazis, racists, and pretty much phobic to anything. It's not like I am already severly depressed... It's like I was having fun today, but then all of a sudden I get my depression and trauma from all those 8 years rubbed in my face again. Yes, I want to kill myself. I have beyond weird stress levels right now and feel like I am about to have a meltdown.

possibly in debt and i wanna die — a vent,"sorry for this in advance. just wanted to vent.

so if you’re a random person scrolling through this sub you probably haven’t read my last post which is fine. i’ll give a tldr. tldr; an online friend’s birthday was today so i haven’t killed myself despite having planned for it today, but due to our time difference, their birthday is now over. so… i’ll probably be doing it in a few hours or tomorrow morning if i can’t sneak the pills tonight.

i was already feeling really fucking terrible, but then my mom comes home and gives me a letter. tldr once again; the hospital wants to deem the last time i visited the er as an “accident” despite me clearly telling them it was an attempt so that my insurance doesn’t have to pay and i do.

first of all, it was not a fucking “accident”. a hanging suicide attempt was not an accident and they should know as much. second of all, i’m only 19 years old, i can’t be in debt, for *fuck’s* sake, and yet look at me. my mom said she’d try to get them to reconsider but it’s not a guarantee and if they don’t that i have to pay. i get it, i’m an adult, but she knows that my mental health is horrible right now and that i don’t have a job yet she’s still making me do that. is she within her legal right? maybe, but she’s still being an asshole. she’s screwing me over when she knows i have no way to fight back this debt. i don’t even know how much it’d be because they never said it.

i’m just so fucking over my life. this is fucking *great.* this is just fucking *fantastic.* (obviously /s.)

afterwards my mom had the audacity to tell me “not to keep doing this to myself” referring to my suicide attempts and she was…. mad. like, legit *mad*. not even concerned. just mad. i assume it was because of the money and how this could happen again. 

that was the last straw in my mind. i have a plethora of reasons i’m gonna end my life but this? this is just the fucking cherry on top. it was right then that i solidified my plan. she does realize telling me not to do it in such an upset tone just makes me want to do it more, right? especially when i know she’s more upset about the money aspect.

fuck you, my brain. 

fuck. 

you. 

edit on 4/11 because i don’t feel like making another whole post about it: so my best friend - or ex best friend now, i guess - just said he didn’t want to be friends with me anymore because “it’s too triggering for “him”. it “isn’t my fault” but “some of my special interests are triggering for him because they associate them with me dying”. god… even though i know it’s for the best and it’s been a long time coming, it really hurt to read that. and although he didn’t mean to, a) the timing was absolutely (unintentionally on his part, he has no idea i’m going to kms) awful because b) it’s made me solidify my plan even more. it just really, really, *really* fucking hurts to be alive.

i’m sorry, dude. i’ll miss you and i wish things could’ve ended differently. 

it’s not your fault. 

i love you.",MedukaMeguca72,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12i0j07/possibly_in_debt_and_i_wanna_die_a_vent/,sorry advance wanted vent random person scrolling sub probably read last post fine give tldr tldr online friend birthday wa today killed despite planned today due time difference birthday probably hour tomorrow morning sneak pill tonight wa already feeling really fucking terrible mom come home give letter tldr hospital want deem last time visited er accident despite clearly telling wa attempt insurance pay first wa fucking accident hanging suicide attempt wa accident know much second 19 year old debt fuck sake yet look mom said try get reconsider guarantee pay get adult know mental health horrible right job yet still making within legal right maybe still asshole screwing know way fight back debt even know much never said fucking life fucking great fucking fantastic obviously afterwards mom audacity tell keep referring suicide attempt wa mad like legit mad even concerned mad assume wa money could happen wa last straw mind plethora reason gonna end life fucking cherry top wa right solidified plan doe realize telling upset tone make want right especially know upset money aspect fuck brain fuck edit 4 11 feel like making another whole post best friend ex best friend guess said want friend anymore triggering fault special interest triggering associate dying god even though know best long time coming really hurt read although mean timing wa absolutely unintentionally part ha idea going km awful b made solidify plan even really really really fucking hurt alive sorry dude miss wish thing could ended differently fault love,possibly debt wanna die vent,med uk meg uc 72

Don't know what to do,"   I don't want to die, I just don't want to deal with it anymore. 
It seems that just when things go going well, something happens. And I just don't want to do it anymore. I'm horrible at this ""adulting"" so to speak. I've pretty much been taken care of my whole life. That is until covid took my other half in 21. Then I lost my best big brother a couple of weeks later . I have been isolated ever since. With no way  of getting out.  We were renting a run down 60 year old mobile home, which I am still in. About a month ago, the furnace went out.  I convinced (yes,I had to convince) the landlord to have a co, come in, and fix it. They did an inspection and discovered micro cracks, meaning it couldn't be fixed, but had to be replaced. It's a gas furnace (as old as the home), and they said there was a chance of Co2 leakage. The landlord threw a fit and said, ""Too much money!"" After I threatened her with an attorney, she said her brother is looking for one ( he is a furnace guy), but it'll take time .they gave me a couple of space heaters. Which will run my electric through  the roof. I had just graduated out of therapy in Dec, and this has thrown me right back in.  It's been like this for the past 2 years. One major thing after another.

Lonely.,"I live in the UK and I'm 14 years old. I'm also overweight and wear glasses. At school I hang out with the popular kids they all like me, everyone likes me. But they all still make fun of me. Like Im not life's joke. I can't remember the last time one of them called me by my name. I just feel so full of love. I love making girls laugh and smile and wish I had a gf. I don't even want anything that all the guys in my year brag about. I just want to be respected like them. Ive been going to the gym for a couple months and feeling alright but I'm not seeing any visual improvements. I just want them to see me as something more than the four eyes fatty who tells jokes. I struggle with chronic insomnia aswell. Nobody thinks of me the way I want them to. Idk if it's selfish to think that way. I'm just a joke, or more often than that a punchline. I'm so so self conscious. I spend all night listening to Radiohead and thinking about how different people would react if I killed myself. My dad would probably too and I could never let that happen he's too nice, and that would ruin my brothers life. My friends would be sad but joke about it in a year. I'm sure my family would cry a little. Maybe a cousin or two would gasp. I think my mum might quit her job. I think about the people I would name drop. People who picked on me, people who ignored me.

I’m considering trying to kill myself again.,"What title says. Honestly I don’t know if i actually want to die or I want someone to understand how much pain I’m in or both but I feel like my finger is hovering over the self destruct button and I don’t know how much more I can take. I am autistic, I might have ADHD, I have borderline personality disorder and I am traumatised, my trauma is the kind seen in complex ptsd but idk if i actually have complex ptsd or not. I also have parents who at times can be kind and helpful and other times trigger me so bad I want to hurt them and hurt myself. Everyday is exhausting. Reminders of my trauma and grief are everywhere. I can’t cope with basic things like housework. I carry so much shame, self loathing, guilt. Everyone in my family thinks I’m getting better because I choose to mask and perform. But I am not. I am just so so tired. I’m tired of waking up feeling like crap and going to sleep feeling like crap. I am tired of everything reminding me of my trauma and feeling I have to self sabotage when I’m feeling good because it’s so unsettling. Nothing makes me feel better. I want to slit my wrists but it’s so hard. I want to overdose but it never works. I was once told I could try buying diving equipment and inhaling like nitrogen oxide or whatever that way, but I’ve got nowhere isolated to go. I don’t know what to do.

I don’t want to live anymore,"Hi everyone, this is my first post so bear with me. I’m a 26 year old female. 
I’m not sure where to start, I have been depressed for a long time, it consumes me to the point where I spend majority of my time asleep. I work from home and I feel incredibly lonely, I’m starting to believe that nobody would notice if I disappeared from the world. 
I have some debts that I’m struggling with and I worry what will happen when I kill myself, if those debts would go to my mum to pay. I have a debt management plan but it will take me years to pay it all off and feel I can breathe again. I don’t think anyone would be sad for long when I die, if people truly cared then where are they? I reach out and get told I’m being silly and to think positively but it’s easier said than done. I don’t have any friends or a partner, I wish I could make some friends but I’m not sure how to do that when I don’t leave the house. I don’t have enough money to eat and rely on food banks but I can’t keep doing this all the time. I worry about money every single day and I don’t see a way out, I know it sounds ridiculous to feel so suicidal over money but I don’t see it getting any better.

The end for me is near and I don't have any other option,"First the synopsis my ex broke up with me 3 weeks ago we were together for a year and 5 months those 5 months we lived together is she broke up with me because I apparently was to clingy because she wanted to spend time with her friends online and I wanted to spend time with her.



I tried on two different occasions to convince her to be with me again and fix what I did the second occasion was today and I told her I was willing to be her friend and she decided the best for her was to cut all contact with me and I understand why, but it hurts that she doesn't want to be in any sort of contact with me I did tell her if for some reason I am still here living that she is more than welcome to contact me again and be friends.

But not having any contact with her along with the fact that she won't take me back has left me no other choice now I don't want to talk to a therapist cuz there's nothing they can do I love my ex so much and I love her dog snowflake so much I have a keepsake bin full of her stuff that she left here at my house I had a good life and I think soon it's a good time to end it because I don't want to be with anyone else I love my ex too much we had a perfect Bond I don't blame her for not wanting to keep in contact.

I thought the video was really attractive so I bookmarked it, and I watched it a lot of times. I never opened up the comments on it until a while after having originally found it, but eventually I did, and one of the replies was something along the lines of ""this girl is 15"". I read that comment and decided to keep watching and returning to that video anyway, up until like 2 or 3 months ago (when I decided to stop watching porn entirely for unrelated reasons and deleted everything I had). Before I read that comment I never even suspected that girl to have been underage, but every time after seeing it the idea that she could be lingered in my head as I chose to masturbate to the video anyway. I didn't want her to be 15, and if the comment was something like ""this girl is 15 and I know it for certain because \_\_\_\_"", I imagine, I HOPE I would have chose to remove it from my bookmarks, report it, and never look at it again, but instead I decided to be stupid and ignorant and tell myself ""there's no way to know if that person's right"" so I could continue to masturbate to that video as much as I wanted without feeling any guilt. I might have even liked the idea that it was something that could have been illegal, maybe it made it more exciting for me. I feel so fucking sick. 

I can't find the exact post of the video with the comment about her being 15, but I can find the same video posted in a ton of other subreddits, including being near one of the top posts in one. No one else seems to think she's 15, and it's been sitting in those other subreddits undeleted for 3 years, but the original gif which was hosted on gfycat was removed. I have no clue if that girl is 15 or not and I probably never will, but it doesn't even matter because I chose to masturbate to her with the idea of her possibly having been well underage in my mind every time I watched it.  

I feel like my life is over. There is no way I can forgive myself for this, and even if I could I don't think it's something the vast majority of people could forgive me for regardless. I just want to die, I know i'm not going to kill myself imminently but I don't think this is something I can ever recover from so there's pretty much no other way out.

Very ugly male recluse,"Male aged 33)

I’m 6ft tall long legs short torso slim black hair receding hairline so yea I’m fucked

Never even touched a girl or spoke a word to or by one since 2012 and that was coworkers who treated me like shit compared to other dudes

I never leave the house now except going the store nearby at night with my hood up and snood covering my face partly and they’re fine with it.

2012-2015: world in a bar (Wetherspoons) it was great at first but then it went horrible. Women managers treating me like shit and bad mouthing me to the boss for nothing when the good looking guys could do no wrong and they’re all up their asses. Women customers 75% of the time were snobby and rude to me but when an attractive guy serves them they’re a different person. 

***One girl in there even said to me ‘we had a vote who we girls in here would stay away from and we picked you’ and then giggled (summed my time in there up)***

Guys were mostly good but I’d get the few ‘he’s an ugly bastard him’ comments when I walked away after serving them.

**Even before I had that job I had a job advisor who treated me poorly and made 0 effort  but put all the effort on to the prison hunky chads who sometimes were abusive**

I left and only did stadium jobs (decent money from it) 2-3 times a week and that was great at first then I noticed things like when I try to help a woman/girl they act all ‘😒’ and roll their eyes at me 

or avoid me and ask someone else further away for help was a regular occurrence 

Had instances where a girl would be with her dad for example and he’s say something to her about me then she’d look over at me and grimace with a disgusted look on her face and he’d be laughing at her playfully 

I’d go out thinking I’d look fine and we’ll and youthful even at 28 but I’d come back sitting still stiff for hours after some shifts at home :/

**▪️even on here I asked about my hairline once on malehairadvice and one comment said ‘very very ugly male’ while another replied to him ‘lol yea he’s clearly balding and hideous as fuck by the way’**

The pandemic came and I seen it a reason to not go out anymore 

I drink a 20cl bottle of scotch every night and smoke weed too (separately) as Iv nothing to look forward to. 

Buy and sell on eBay and make profit to fund it and collect things.

Give it time,"4 months ago I tried to kill myself

I researched all the ways to do it without alerting my family that is how I took my life.
I took over 50 paracetamol within 24 hrs and I waited for the end.

The end never came.

I thought I was a failure even at taking my own life… but now even though my life is still falling apart, I found a light. I found someone who saw me for me and didn’t look away. Who saw me and still reached out their hand and told me that they needed to have someone like me in their world and so I am here, I stayed. 
I stayed and I went to a psychologist and I broke down and I showed my darkness and they didn’t turn away.

I’m not saying I still want to be here. Some days it’s hard. Today is hard. But I can see a light through my darkness

So I have told myself I will give it time. What is time if I am going to die anyway, what is a few more days if I get to see a smile on my children’s faces before I vanish.

I just tell myself, a little more time. I have a plan and i can always do that tomorrow 

The trick is, tomorrow never comes… just give it time.",cursedt86,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12hl5qu/give_it_time/,4 month ago tried kill researched way without alerting family took life took 50 paracetamol within 24 hr waited end end never came thought wa failure even taking life even though life still falling apart found light found someone saw look away saw still reached hand told needed someone like world stayed stayed went psychologist broke showed darkness turn away saying still want day hard today hard see light darkness told give time time going die anyway day get see smile child face vanish tell little time plan always tomorrow trick tomorrow never come give time,give time,cursed 86

Age brings stillness as the freedom of youth is crowded by the failings of a lifetime,"Young me thought he was wise, always quick to argue and offend. He fancied himself good looking and interesting, and failed as a friend and a son on many fronts. Old me looks back on those days with embarrassment, but he used to be able to look forward with hope. Now, a lifetime later, I sit at the precipice of an insurmountable debt, a shocking loss of time and growth to a cruel partner and a profound sense of doubt about my role in the failings of my life.  Fear and disappointment courses through my muscles lending me a sense of soreness and fatigue that goes soul deep.

Waking up in the morning has become increasingly difficult, and I find myself hiding from everyone who tries to be a friend so they wont stall my acceptance of the reality that I, cosmically and fundamentally, am a faceless party to a reality that feels tied to a long form contract full of clauses and conditions designed to collar us all and keep us from rising to our potential. 

However, suicide is still an abstract concept to me. The idea of ending things permanently vibrates against my inborn will to survive, but more and more that instinct feels like a particularly devious means of entrapment. What unfeeling entity made the human drive to live so strong that it both encloses them in their circumstances when there is now way out, *and* creates a profound fear of time and age? 

All said, I know I am too attached to living to end things, but I also know I'm still rolling downward, and who knows what the depths of this drop hold for me. I'm not writing this because I want to be talked out of or into something drastic. I'm hoping that, by explaining these feelings and the sense of defeat and loss that I can't seem to navigate, I can at least give shape to this formless energy and find a place in my psyche that can hold it until it fades away.

How do you get the help you need?,"I asked this once before and i still need help. Yesterday I attempted suicide, the blade wasn't sharp enough, it still bled like hell, but obviously i survived. I really want to get help but i'm scared. I have one person, that i could tell everything but he has mental problems of his own, so i don't know if i should. The only other way i see is to hospitalize myself or call the police, i would feel uncomfortable doing both. 
I want to get help but in my current situation, i feel like i'm stuck and destined to get worse until i kill myself or get hospitalized trying. 
Is there another way that i just don't see? Is it really this hard to get help or am i just stupid?

I'm not sure what to do,"I've wanted to be a doctor my whole life. Ive always been good at school but this year has been different, I'm really struggling and my exams are in less than 2 weeks. I need to get all A's to get into med school and they don't allow resits so it's sink or swim basically. Im currently sitting at a B in most classes but if I fail these exams then it's game over, my entire dream and future is just gone. 

If I fail these exams, which I am 90% sure I will. I don't know if there is a point in continuing, I don't have many friends, my family relationships are strained at best, and if I fail then my entire future that I have planned since I was 10 just collapses with nothing else I can do about it. I don't want to work in a shitty retail job for the rest of my life, if I fail there's nothing else I can do. So I might as well just kill myself right? 

I don't even feel sad or panicked while writing this, I've attempted suicide before so what's one more try? I'm trying to look at my situation objectively, if I can't be a doctor what else do I do? I bring no other value to society from an objective standpoint, nothing would change if I died.

I could do it tonight... at any time.,"And it would be great. I lost my intellect following a concussion and quite honestly dont have anything else that I can think of as ""good"" about me. Sadly my parents somehow havent caught on the fact their ""son"" (who died with the injury) is a completly failure and will lament my death, which I certainly dont want to put them through.

But unlike fake hope there is nothing binding me to this life. I am the one choosing to eat this shit plate I have given to myself following mistake after mistake (concussion was pretty much my responsability). There is no better tomorrow, no miracolous recovery. Just me and my stubborn ass. I think the fact I view this mindset as ""positive"" is probably from my brain being broken after the concussion, but the way I see it is that I could choose to leave life and meet my old self at any point in time, and I am willingly choosing to continue driving this beaten up vessel.

It gave me hope,"You see, life in itself has no inherent value or meaning, eventually we die and every thing we did is just like that not there anymore, I think that people spend their life searching for something they can call “A reason to live for” but in reality they are just trying to justify “Why they live”.

Truth is, I have no thing that I want to live for; and don’t get me wrong, I just can’t overlook the absurdity of it all; the never ending struggle and suffering for a moment of false happiness in a life that is eventually over. 

A while back I wanted to change life and all this pointless childish dreams, and I always thought that even in the worst case scenario; I can always kill my self. But no, I can’t do that or I am condemning myself to hell. You see, It’s not just that I don’t have anything to live for; It’s that I don’t see a point in having such a thing. 

Every day I wake up, feeling nothing except a void in my heart, not even able to look myself in the mirror without feeling that raging desire to remove that useless existence out of this pointless life.

I’m not a good student, I’m unmotivated to do anything besides eating, drinking, and sleeping. 

I don’t want to marry or have kids, mainly because I’ve been rejected 3 times already, with none of them giving any shits about me, and I don’t want to feel the pain of relationships anymore. They’re also too much work for me as well.

I’m too embarrassed about everything to talk about any problems with anyone, including counselors, therapists, or doctors. 

I honestly don’t expect to live past 21, and the only reasons I’m still alive now is because I would feel selfish for leaving family and friends behind if I did. I’m lost, and I don’t know what to do.

I don't feel like I should have a place in this world.,"I think I should die. I really want to and I feel like a huge burden.. I don't know if this feeling in my head is real and that this is all there is, but I think I am the biggest of a burden. I'm trying really hard not to listen to the judgemental/hurtful people everyday because I know our perceptions are just different and they can't understand but I feel the worst possible existence. I keep getting targeted a lot in school and I think all the people there, even the ones who don't care about me hold a disliking to me and would be much happier if I weren't having to be looked at. 

It's been like that my entirety of time in school because of how I am. I am different and bad to the ideals others have been taught but I don't think it means I shouldn't deserve to live like everyone else does. 

I think I should get a chance but it feels I really don't deserve any of it. I've started burdening even the nicest people which I care for and love. I have always been privileged to have a small amount of online friends who will put up with me despite me being really bad at socializing. I feel like the only reason they ever did was because they are nice people and hold that as their personality. I don't really have a personality and I just feel annoying. 

I always relied on them way too much and held them at the center of my world because I have a lot of issues attatching to people who will treat me with decency and show me attention. I tried to cling to them to get through everyday of being bullied and living an existence like this but it seems like I ended up only burdening them too. 

I feel sad when they don't prioritize me at all even though I know I don't deserve it and people should chose the best people for them so they can be made happy. I always have to apologize for one thing or another because I just feel like I'm not good enough at all and there's so many regular things I can't do. 

If I am like that even to the people I love, even to my family, even to the people at school who don't even know me I don't feel deserving of trying to live.

Ready to go,"So I've decided I'm ready to die. I'm nearly 30, body is falling apart, unable to go for surgery in Germany due to being unable to fly. The longer I live the worse everything gets.
Asked a friend to help and they wouldn't.
I despise every second of my job and can't afford to go back to college.
Everyone else around me has a far far better life.
I don't cry anymore ever since an event at Christmas. I don't have family I can lean on at all.
I'm fully ready to go and I've looked into the best ways to do it.
I really am the exact person who if I died no one's life would be really affected.

I don't think I'm meant to be here,"The only reason I made this account was so I don't have anyone figuring out that it's me. I genuinely don't think I was ever supposed to be here living. Never felt like it. I was 11 when I first attempted and didn't even know what suicide was, all I knew was that I'd feel better afterwards. I decided I would try to overdose on my antidepressants and I made the dumb decision to post a very concerning image and caption on social media and my friends told their parents, who spam-called my parents for the next 2 hours to ask if I was ok. I told my parents it was a misunderstanding- I didn't mean it and was only joking around when I said that. My psychiatrist explained the implications of what I'd written and I don't think any of them know that the worst pain I've ever felt to this day was when I woke up after and realised that I was still alive. Since then I've had four more, and only one of those went noticed, though it didn't really result in anything.

They said I would get better but I'm 20 now and I feel even worse, to be honest. I haven't heard back from my psychiatrist in about 8 months, and the last appointment I was scheduled to have I was left sitting in the waiting room for over 90 minutes. I haven't had contact with my psychologist for about 4 months either, and I haven't heard back from when I tried to schedule an appointment 3 weeks ago. My parents think I'm taking my medication but I stopped last year. It wasn't working, and nothing has worked long-term. I'm rationing my ADHD medication because I haven't heard back from my psychiatrist still and the prescription expired in October of 2022. My regular GP can't prescribe it, I can't see another psychiatrist without a referral, and I can't get a new referral for about 2-3 weeks. Those of you who have ADHD know it's a bad idea but what choice do I have?

I was prescribed a blood pressure medication to help me sleep after I'd taken my ADHD medication but it's just sitting on the shelf now. I put hours into researching the effects of the medication, the toxic dose and the probability of surviving an overdose and it's pretty grim. I don't know whether I want to die or I just want it to do enough damage for people to see that I'm hurting. I feel like tonight is the night. I might just drink a bubble tea, take whatever's in the box, put some music on and fall asleep with my dog hogging 3/4 of my bed. I'm counting on my parents being out of the house tomorrow so they won't notice that anything is wrong until they come home in the evening and by that point it'll probably be too late to do anything. Or I'll wake up feeling like shit and pretending that I just stayed up really late. I've written so many notes that I hope they will never have to read, and I don't think they suspect anything since I made sure to mention several ""projects"" that I never plan to finish. Maybe I'll chicken out later when the permanence of death really gets to me but until then this is the best I've got.

I cried for the first time in forever just now,"Idk how I feel about it, I’ve been on medication for around a month and I feel great that I can actually cry; but if I’m being completely honest it was forced.

Just listening to music alone and I felt the urge so I acted upon it, and I think I’m glad I did? I still don’t really know, but I think it was a good thing.

Gotta raise my med dose, though; I’ve been playing it safe so I don’t get sent to a psych ward so I downplay my depression and deny suicidal tendencies (even though those are true…) point is that I’ve been through 4 different meds now and this is the only one that has actually done something, I think.

Nothing has helped. Not a thing.,"My full post is in my history. I am mid a divorce, 1 month from today it will be finalized. I put 100% of everything I had into this relationship. I was 29 and she was 19 when we started dating and I was 2 years out my first divorce. She left me 5 years in, not even 1  year married. Criticize me for the age difference being a mistake. I’m sure it was.

She cheated on me twice and left me for the other man. I lost my job, my father passed in the midsts, and I’m restarting from a paycheck to paycheck job with a promotion into the sales team on the horizon.

I have been forcing myself to go out with friends as much as I can, I have forced myself to meet people. I had a FWB for a couple weeks before they moved states. I’ve been talking to two women online, both of which are poly and married, and they love me but I can only feel the tiniest affection toward them because of my mental health. They are both amazing, kind, caring people, far more empathy than my ex and far more open with communication. These things helped on the very short term only. It’s like im craving something to give me reprieve from the painful experience of existing.

This last week has been near unbearable. I’ve had to take long lunches at my new job to calm down, I’ve been in tears every single morning and it used to last an hour and now I’m fighting it off until late afternoon.

I started smoking weed again. This takes the edge off but I feel my tolerance increasing and the next day is usually worse after smoking.


The ideations which went away for a couple weeks are back in full force. I don’t want to live like this. I can’t trust, I can’t feel, I literally can’t see myself being happy again. There is no future where I see myself recovering from this and being happy with my existence. I’m 34, my father passed of FTD and there’s a 50% chance I inherited it and will start a long 7 year dementia as early as 58. I wasted my 20s with my first wife and my early 30s with my second, and my dreams of having children has all but deteriorated due to the health concerns being genetic and now having to restart at 34.

i don't understand,"Someone who doesn't want to live tries to make an attempt and is saved without them having any choice in it, and the result is thousands of dollars in hospital bills? I don't get it. If someone doesn't want to live, shouldn't that be their choice? If they don't want to be saved, why are they still given treatment and being charged for it? It feels like a punishment- ""Don't try to kill yourself, or else we'll force you to live and pay thousands of dollars for the treatment we gave to you"". Wouldn't that just make them want to die more? No one asks to be born, so why are we forced to live like this? I just don't get it.

Maybe it's not quite like that with hospitals everywhere, but that's how it was with my attempt (good ol fucking america, right?). I don't know how much it cost for me to be in the ER but i know the mental hospital (which i didn't honestly have much of a choice in going) was at least six thousand.

I should have done it when I had the chance.,"Years ago I was put in medication for anxiety and depression, but the pills made it so much worse. I was manic and crossed the line into suicidal. I planned on taking the entire bottle but I contacted the hotline instead and ended up going to sleep.

I am so unhappy with the direction my life has taken since, and I feel like I should have ended it when I had the chance. I hate everything around me, modern media is either depressing, pandering crap, or inflammatory political nonsense designed to divide and conquer. On top of that my partner is a lazy ass who doesn't help me clean and we both work (though I do work less than him) so I'm not able to keep up with it.

It's surprisingly hard to die,"suicide is supposed to be as a result of not wanting to suffer living life right? so the methods should be painless. but they're difficult to come by and that's really the only reason i haven't gone through with it

take pills? which ones and how much to make sure they can't revive me which is also another reason i cant go through with it. how humiliating that would be to be surrounded by 'friends&amp;family' at your literal rock bottom

Really struggling,"Recently I've been really struggling with everything and I struggle to see a way out or where I can be strong enough to get through everything.

I am 29, I was a teaching assistant but I just lost my job because I couldnt sort some paperwork for an abroad police check. 

I feel miserable. I go out all the time and take drugs, drink heavily on my own just to stop feeling. 

I am getting older. I'm gay, and thats kinda terrifying. I don't want to be over 30. 

I'm dealing with PSSD. Its a medical conidtion where you come off anti-depresssants and you not longer have the same level of sexualy function or desire. 

I messed up a chance at a relationship with this guy, it was a year ago when everything fell apart but I still can't get over him. Evertyime I'm low I think about him, and the only thing which makes me feel better is to indulge in fantasies about him, and my life being less shit.   


I don't know how I will get a new job after being fired 

  
I don't know who I will get the will to stay more sober or be happier in my life  


I don't know if I will ever have a partner again, one because I am so embarrassed about my life and it makes it hard to look people in the eye and two the pSSD, and three because I just want the last guy, I don't want anyone else.   


I don't know how I will get through this and I find myself just wanting to give up. I just find myself wanting to give in. I don't really want to but it feels more logical right now. It would make everything easier. I don't see the point. and everyday feels like such a battle.

How can I recover after the wost psychotic break I've had?,"I lost a LOT. I went through a LOT. I wasted months of my life hiding from my own imagination. I ended up on the streets. I'm here. The financial hit was enormous. I threw away everything because I was afraid for my life. None of it was real. I think. The truth is i still don't know because I still think ""surely it couldn't *all* be in my head. Maybe some of it was real... maybe there still a threat out there. I'm traumatized from literal months of living in grave fear in a tent away from society.

How can I ever know the truth? If i face it and it was real then my life is over. I'm slowly traversing back into my old world but I'm still afraid if the wrong people find out where i am then something bad will happen to me.

I stayed in a fucking mouse infested tent because I was terrified of what was outside of it. I got frostbite 5 fucking times. I have possibly permanent nerve damage from it. I starved. I froze. I wore the same pair of clothes unable to shower or change underwear for 30 fucking days. Then when I finally came out of the tent from desperation I had to hold a fucking sign to beg for money for food. Thank you so much to the people who fed me or gave me money to eat... I still remember every single one of them. I wore a mask and covered my entire face for another couple months everywhere i went. I developed a fake identity and even had to give it to the police and got my fingerprint taken with that name before being let go. Felony. I could go on forever about every fucking excruciating detail.

So how the fuck am I supposed to ever move on from this and recover. Especially when it could just happen again at any fucking time?

I went through too much. And it wasn't even real. And I still don't belive it wasn't fully. Which means I'm still going through it.

Too much of a coward to actually do it,"The only reason I'm alive today is because I don't live near a train track and i don't have access to a gun. 

So many times I've drove my car to a railway with the intention of ending it all, just to cry for hours and drive back home. Today is one of those days

I feel so empty. I feel so alone. I feel like shit, every single day. Yet I am unable to pull through with it. I am nothing but a coward who drowns himself in a sea of self loathing and resentment towards everyone. 

But no matter how much i push everyone away, nobody cares, not a single text, not a single person asking how I'm doing. I genuinely think that nobody would miss me when I'm gone.",Extension_Ad6691,6,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12h5lcv/too_much_of_a_coward_to_actually_do_it/,reason alive today live near train track access gun many time drove car railway intention ending cry hour drive back home today one day feel empty feel alone feel like shit every single day yet unable pull nothing coward drowns sea self loathing resentment towards everyone matter much push everyone away nobody care single text single person asking genuinely think nobody would miss gone,much coward actually,extension ad 6691
I wish I would die in my sleep.,"at the end of February, I was taken into the psych ward for being suicidal. During my time there I was scared to come home because I knew as soon as I did I would be alone again, and I would still be in the same situation I was before. I begged everyone to not leave me alone before. 

I came home and exactly what I feared happened. Everyone is too busy for me or they forget I exist. I am utterly alone again. I'm nothing to anyone. I am a failure at everything. I could die today and no one would know for weeks.

I'm also in a worse off financial situation. When I went into the psych ward I was a month behind on rent. When I got out I was two months behind.  Now its three months. 

Ontop of that I got suspended from my job, a job that hate and it makes me suicidal and pays shit. So now things are going to get worse. 

I am trying to switch careers to something that I like but I don't have the right qualfications and I can't afford college. 

I'm tired of feeling like a spider in a toilet bowl. Working hard, getting nowhere. My financial situation is so bad I can't even afford to go back to the psych ward, I don't even have time to have a break down! 

The only thing keeping me here is worrying about what would happen to my pets if I did it. I don't know how much longer I can hold on tho.

"Failure to launch, why should I keep myself alive? Everything is about money.","As the title says, I failed to leave the nest, I'm 24 now, still living with my parents, and it looks like that won't change for at least a decade. I tried college and it didn't work out, I'm just not mentally prepared to deal with the stress and I end up blocking and not doing the assignments. If that's college then I can't even imagine what would happen in an actual job with my livelihood on the line. The stress would literally kill me. I can't do college, I can't keep a job for long, I can't do anything right. I am a failure and it hurts me every day that I wake up. 

Part of me wishes I could change, but honestly I don't even know what to do or what to aim for. It's too late to start college again, and whatever job I can get  without a degree won't pay rent in this fucking country. I don't  want to commit  crimes either. The only way I see is the way of the rope.

Oblivion,"Even knowing I’m going to end it… I don’t know how I should feel—and I believe that is my answer. My trauma isn’t something that I can halfheartedly “make peace with”. There are many things I will never get closure for. The kind of closure that could placate me is impossible anyway. Everything is ambiguous. Maybe it makes sense that my life would end that way. I don’t need to feel particularly sad or particularly happy.

 I don’t need to guilt trip anyone or send distressing messages hoping that someone will care enough to talk me down. I don’t want to be talked down anymore. In fact, I want to be encouraged. I’m seeking oblivion. Of course not knowing what comes next can be frightening. It’s human nature to fear what we don’t know.

I need help,"I went through a bad break up because my partner didn’t really understand my BPD and traumas well even though I tried to educate them and everything. This relationship has been abusive towards me, I’ve talked to countless people and professionals and they always told me to get out of the relationship because I was being treated badly. The problem is I never could because they were my FP I was so attached to them and I tried so hard to change for them, I never took my emotions out on them and was aware of my triggers and when I would be having an episode, I never blamed them for anything and told them that it wasn’t their fault I’m having these insecurities and that I just needed reassurance, they would get upset at me so often and I felt bad about sharing any of my feelings with them, they often threatened to break up with me instead of working things out with me so it made me so paranoid to bring up anything at all that I felt had the smallest chance of making them upset. I hid my feelings a lot and choked them down, I tried my hardest but in the end they broke up with me and said some really hurtful things to me. Ever since then my BPD has been hurting me like crazy and I try so hard to tell myself I wasn’t in the wrong and look for comfort with friends but it doesn’t help, each day gets progressively worse and I find ending my life so comforting.

I’m a loser and I’m ugly
Spend my nights all alone,
No one ever comes to see me 
Had the blinds shut for days
Can’t stand to see outside 
Don’t think anyone would notice
If I died here tonight 
Yeah, the only thing to stop me
Is the pain I’d cause my mother 
She’s lost two kids already 
I can’t let her lose another 
But I spend my days in pain 
Nothing interests me no more

I can't find joy in living anymore.
I don't find interesse on my old hobbies.
Don't have willpower to workout anymore, I'm just so tired, and my body looks like shit again (not that it ever looked good).
Finally talked with my ex, and now I don't feel anger or sadness (for the most part), I just feel empty, I didn't thought I could ever talk to him again, that was the only ""objective"" I had left.
Ruin my last relationship because I'm imitur and didn't had moved on from my ex, even though it has been 2 years.
Today was Easter, it went like any other holiday I ever had, my family screamed and argued, and I ended up with the blame, and just went to my room.
I just can't keep living like this.
I'm already here, might as well do it, finally and stop being a pussy.
I will send my suicide note to my own email, my sister knoww the password, I'll send her a text telling her to go check my email in the morning.
I guess that's all, goodbye everyone.
Hope y'all can go through whatever you're going through, see you all on the other side.

My Ex Girlfriend got R***** a Day After we Broke Up.,"Hey guys, I really need help. I'm 19M and my ex is 18F. We have known each other for two years and have dated for one. My ex has always been suicidal, but only told me about it 6 months into dating. She has become extremely reliant on me. We would spent almost every single day together and would fall asleep on the phone every night. She has lost almost every single friend because she spends every second possible with me. I have felt so miserable dating her; constantly worrying about her unaliving, losing most of my friends, comforting her and trying to help her feel better, etc. I previously attempted to break up with her, but she cried uncontrollably until she passed out and told me I was the only thing she had left. I felt so bad and was so worried what she might do, I told her I would continue to date her. About a week ago, I decided that I am going to break up with her for good. I planned a trip out of the state so she would be unable to come to my house and beg. Before breaking up with her, I called her parents and told them what I was going to do and also that she is suicidal. I break up with her, she sobs uncontrollably, but I stand my ground and board the plane. Two days after I leave, she goes out with some friends, including a guy. Some of the friends leave, just leaving her and the guy. He R\*\*\*\*\* her in his car that night. She called me yesterday and finally had the courage to tell me what happened. She hasn't told anyone besides me, because I am the only one she trusts. I feel so devastated for her and can't even imagine how this feels for her on top of the breakup. I have a terrible feeling that If I stop talking to her (She will never stop calling/texting on her own, so my only option is to block her,) She will actually commit suicide. Right now, she is begging to keep talking on the phone for ""one more week."" I know that I should stop talking to her, but I don't want the guilt if she does unalive herself.

I cant do this for a lot longer,"Ive always been sick. There hasnt been a day ive not been sick, half off my childhood i spent it on hospitals. Every time i get dick its worse than the other, my lungs hurt when i breathe. Every time i breathe is like acid is being poured on my lungs. While i spent half of my life being sick, none really cared. They either grew used to me being this way or just dont care. Most likely dont care as they as busy with their own problems. I dont want pity. Every single moment im awake causes me pain, so i sleep. I sleep to forget and i sleep to ease the pain ive been constantly living with silently. 

And i did try once to tell people about my condition but it was dismissed and ignored. As ive gotten older ive obly realised a few things. Im gettong sicker, i might catch an infection one day and suffer till i die and i wont care, im so done with this shit. Ive never taken a breath of air and felt it be refreshing or good. I cant smell abything with perfume cus it hurts. Soap hurts my nose, strong food smells hurt my nose. Shampoo hurts. Anything sweet too, a slighly cold breeze hurts same with hot air. Freezing air is the worst. Ive tried so many medicines and nothing works. 

As i said before i spent half of my childhood in hospitals, ive been tested, medicated and im done with all that. I stoped taking my meds a few months ago cus im done with them too. The only reason im still here alive, posting this is because i have a sister from another mother that i dont want her to carry that pain, and my baby sister who is only 7. I dont want her to be traumatized so young.

I can't live,"To start I'm an 18 y/o male, single as of last night, my mum has untreatable cancer and I was manipulated by my ex.
Let's start, 2018 I was 13, I got in a relationship with a girl I had a crush on for years, it was all going well until about march of 2019 when we started to drift apart because my social anxiety was getting so bad I could barely leave my bedroom, let alone talk to people in school but she started to say things like ""if you loved me you'd come over and talk to my friends"" I tried to talk to her about how I felt physically sick thinking about leaving my room and she called me pathetic. She broke up with me around May 2019. I was 14 and I started drinking very heavily as a coping mechanism, I managed to quit it but then I started to self harm (I won't go into details but I have scars that make me scared to wear t-shirts with too short sleaves). Fast forward 5 months I had 1 attempt at suicide and many trips to the train station and long thoughts about jumping. But in comes my now ex, I'm gonna call her p. P is the girl of my dreams she is pretty cleaver funny and is into all the same things as me, we started talking in October and she helped me stop self harming, we talked and started dating in late December 2019. I was so happy, I found my soul mate. We had 3 wonderful years together with long talks about marriage and starting a family, which brings us to yesterday. I had been in holiday with my family and she was on a camp with cadets. We both got home yesterday and I was so excited to see her. She said we should go for a drive (she has a licence I don't) and I was really excited. I got in her car with her easter egg and presents I bought her from Disney but she looked away. She drove us to somewhere quiet and told me that she had been thinking about us having a break for a few weeks to months but was too scared to tell me but that night she was kissed by someone on her camp and didn't stop because she liked it. I'm currently angry sad confused and drunk as I write this.

Now onto my mum, she has a rare cancer which should be easily treated but because of the shear incompetence of the NHS it spread significantly before we went private and its now at the point of no return. I think is one is self explanatory.

Now onto me, I'm pretty sure I have autism and adhd and I'm looking into getting tested for them, I'm also trying to get a diagnosis of depression and anxiety but I really don't know how long these are going to take. I'm starting my alevelsin May and I'm currently unable to do anything to prepare or study.

Does anyone have any advice. It can be for any of my many issues. All my teachers say is start revising because you only get what you deserve but I'm too depressed to open a text book or read an article.

I believe I will drink myself to death.,"It’s not exactly suicide. But the mix of the amount of alcohol intake combined with the amount of prescription drugs is lethal. I have been mixing the the two daily, since the end of January. 

I know that each night, there’s a 50-50 chance that I will not wake up. And I don’t care. I’ve lost so much the last few years. A miscarriage. An ended engagement. The death of a close friend. Addiction. A manic episode that left me $6000 in debt. And my closest friends through the years hardly reply to my texts anymore. Most recently, after ending a relationship with her, my most recent partner told me good luck killing myself. 

I wake up each day, go to work, and either head straight to a bar, and drink myself into a blackout, or I fuck a stranger off the Internet, and then drink myself into a blackout. 

There is no longevity in what I’m doing. But truthfully, I want it all to end sooner rather than later.

hopeless 20 yr old dropout loser,"I feel bad that I have this reddit account just for when it gets really bad. Sometimes nothing helps at all, I try to talk friends but I hate worrying people or having to explain so much. 

I'm just so tired, I've had a disease or health condition take over my life since I was 14 (just turned 20). My health has gotten so bad recently I had to withdraw from college, I feel like a failure and waste. My health was a large part of dropping out, but also self harm was too. I relapsed two months ago, I've been cutting (on and off recovered) since I was 13/14. 

I dont know what set it off, I felt fine after therapy... but I had my apartment to myself and couldn't stop thinking about it and relapsed. I stopped going to therapy after that, I felt so guilty. I stopped seeing friends. All I could think of was doing it again, the shame, and all that stuff. My health issues flared up at the same time and I just gave up. I gave up on school, on my social life, therapy, and everything. All my clubs and passions, I dropped everything to lay motionless in bed only to get up for self harm or go to work. I feel like I'm stuck in a cycle of self sabotage and harm I cant escape. I fantasize about doing horrible things to myself constantly and I'm scared. It hasn't been this intense since I almost last attempted.

It just makes me feel so so hopeless. Nothings changed in six years, I'm still the sick kid who cuts. Now I'm a dropout with about three friends near me that all have friend groups and things going for them. My gf gives me hope, but I feel like I just hold her back most the time. She has a great social life and is graduating soon in the STEM industry. She's so amazing and has to hear me cry about how lonely and depressed I am. I don't want to be a dead weight she drags around, I already feel like a loser bf. I'm just so stuck, and I've been stuck for years. I'm the problem in my life and I dont know how to fix myself.

 I dont know I just want to know if other people in their 20s feel so hopeless and stuck, it feels like everyone around me has some idea of what they're doing.

I'm obese, and my memory is getting so bad I can barely remember stuff I read or watch a few weeks later, get barely any sleep, and have no motivation to do anything at all. Really the only thing stopping me from suicide is the fear of the suicide being painful or drawn out, or having complications if it fails. I've tried to turn my life around by trying to lose weight, trying to become social again, etc. I've had mental problems since 4th grade or so sue to trauma and after covid it just became even worse.

any kind people have a moment to spare?,"Hello Reddit

I figured I'd give this a try and see if anybody has any advice that would help steer me away. I've had suicidal thoughts since 14 or 15 I guess; typical sad story grew up in a difficult household through a divorce and ultimately deceased father. Removed myself from the rest of the family once I could because they are awful people and made me miserable, calling me slurs, etc. 

I since moved out and then moved away. Didn't really have any friends when I left, and since moving here like 7 months ago I haven't made a single friend. Given, I've only tried dating/friend apps and can't get myself to go anywhere in person to try and make friends alone. I leave my apartment like once a week on average, sometimes sooner sometimes later. I recently ended up in the ER with heart issues and had to quit taking my Adderall XR hat I started mid December. Well, i initially dropped down to 5mg from 25mg, and that was still giving me issues so I had to quit completely as it appears I developed reynauds. 

I dont have money. I work an ok customer service job (it's work from home, and they're nice) and am writing this on my lunch break because it's been all I can think about today. I have severe psoriasis that covers my entire body, apparently reynauds, end up having an allergy or now a heart issue from all the psychiatric medications I've tried. Antidepressants, adderall, several different kinds like ssri snri and some others. Adderall was helping, but rip. Prone to several other issues due to psoriasis, never seen a dentist so that's a whole shitstorm I haven't even opened up yet. It feels like so much is permanently wrong with me and I can't afford any treatment or doctors for any of it anymore. 

I just dont know what else to do anymore. My cat has always been what kept me from going because she has only ever liked me and is scared of my absence, but it's getting so bad I want to do it anyways despite loving her to death. I'm lonely. I spend all of my freetime distracting myself by playing a video game.  I want to ""live on and see what life could be"" but I've been trying that for 8 years and it's never been something that great. I've been missing work and feel like I may have to clock out early today which would put me at negative attendance points and cause further issues with that. I'm concerned that there's nothing anyone can say to make me feel better, want to continue trying, or whatever else but I wanted to try because there's so many different perspectives available and maybe someone has one that'll get through to me. I'd love to see life maybe be something but it hasn't been and I just don't know how many more days I can take of this torment just for a ""maybe"" because I could be damaged beyond repair. I've never been able to study and get a better paying job like I want to, already dropped out of college twice. I've explored options for online certifications but I just have absolutely 0 motivation to try any of it and I don't know how to get motivated. I see a lot of nice tiktoks / slideshows that sometimes inspire me but I never end up doing anything. I can't look at myself in the mirror or brush my teeth consistently. 

If anybody has the time to read my post and procure a response that would be really kind. I don't expect anybody to inject me with feel happy and have hope but any response, perspective, or advice is greatly appreciated.

Taking my life.,"Y'know, it'd be so nice and easy if we had a little switch in our brains or something, and just by thinking about a certain thing we could just die. It would just shut down the whole body and stuff. it'd make this shit Alot easier, huh?

People always asks what more they could've done to save them, but then turns around and puts people in institutions to be 'fixed' for these feelings. If it's so normal to feel this low, then why can no one talk about it?

I've come to the realization that even if i got professional help, that i wouldn't be cured. That i wouldn't really be able to talk about what I'm feeling. or more accurately, the lack of.  I've also come to the realization that my life has no purpose, nothing that makes it different than any others. Nothing that warrants me to live.

I have no feelings when i talk to people, let it be strangers, friends, family (for the most part.) , Others. Watching things i Don't feel anything either, everything is just boring.

 My family gets so angry, that I'm being selfish by not talking to them, or not smiling when i should, or crying when i should, not letting them know how i feel and the list goes on. Sometimes they get so angry at me, or just things around, that they smash things on the floor or throw things. Only then i can really pinpoint a feeling, which is usually fear or sadness. Anything loud or yelling triggers this though.

Sometimes when I'm in my room I'll think of something, or ill see something that reminds me of memories and start feeling sad, and scared and it won't go away for hours, sometimes days. I could lie to myself and say I dont know the problem, which is only a half truth.

 Memories i won't let go of, i still hold a grudge even though it's been years. I'm still frightened by them. I still feel worthless, and i only wish i could prove to someone what they've done.  I know that something is wrong with me as a person, and I'm horrible for putting my family through this . I know most of it was years ago but i can't get rid of it. These things play through my mind on loop and i can't get a hold of my self, i dont even know who i am as a person anymore. 

Being locked in a tight closet for hours, given black eyes for lying as a toddler,  being locked outside in a snowstorm, making me walk around the block in the pitch dark for failing that spelling test, throwing away all my toys as a child, not even letting me keep anything, because we were moving , and so many other things i Don't want to even name here cause so hard to write let alone think about. 

I feel so dirty, especially when i think of the unhygienic gross ones. But these all happened years ago, it should be fine now, my life should be a dream. But it's not, i can't stop remembering these things, i can't get past them. For awhile they kept telling me that they never happened,.that i was crazy. Then they say 'well it happened years ago, you should forgive us by now!'.

I'm not meant to win and I'm tired of fighting for myself. / Bio,"This is lengthy and I'm sorry I can't condense my thoughts here.

I was born with a cerebral palsy, and for the better part of my childhood it affected my physical development; though I came around through some years of rehabilitation training, my self esteem was definitely targeted in being bullied by other children; including such events as being choked out by several kids. At home I was experiencing abuse, neglect, and often abandonment at the hands of my mom and her boyfriend; my parents divorced when I was 5 and she shipped us(my older sister and I) off to the fucking hood with her and found a cocaine addict she thought she could fix(her words). When my younger sisters were born and I was a little older they were often dropped on me to take care of and I effectively raised them in my parent's stead while they worked for people that rarely paid them if they weren't getting trashed outright. Cue eviction after eviction. My unhappiness with everything then definitely made me a bit of a sensitive kid back then, so naturally that bullying followed me until I dropped out at 16. The violence was getting intense at home and I was practically fighting the dumb boyfriend off every fucking day. I offhandedly mentioned I was feeling suicidal to my mom once, and she decided to weaponize it for me that day on with emotional blackmail. After a particular violent fight at 18 with the boyfriend where he threw my own fucking mom at me, and seeing how she still defended him, I realized this was my fucking life if I stayed there. I realized that this was my sister's lives if I didn't do something. So I moved to be near my bio dad and get a fresh start, and surprised the fuck out of myself. I worked harder than I ever did worrying about myself instead of being forced to take care of others for the first time ever and even made some friends, got my diploma, and even some college creds during the end of my senior year. My dissociation was fading and I felt genuinely like a person for the first time. Then my fucking dad gets diagnosed with cancer, and then all the drama of that end of the family comes out; dad cursed his family out on his death bed for their mistreatment of him.. There was considerable favoritism in that family but it really all clicked for me then; I went no-contact with them afterward when they told me they're thankful I can be around to replace him. Thats your son, your brother, your uncle, what the absolute fuck? I tried reconnecting with mom who was homeless at the time because people can change right and its been years? I found out all the money I sent was being used to fuel her boyfriend and her's heroin addiction and not food which I lost around 15k on doing. Thank god friends of the family took and supported the sisters during this time at the very least, and they're way better off today all on their own.

I moved in with a friend down the line and spent a few years understanding myself, looking into mental health, self help, everything while I got into the best shape of my life and even tried dating at the end of it; probably to one of the most narcistic, neurotic, and shitty person who sapped the absolute momentum I was building up. Last year I winded up getting diagnosed with cancer myself and finished treatment in december. I tried to keep my spirit upbeat and continue college which I'm doing high honors for something good going on, but I'm so fucking tired. Its just a series of losses and very few wins. I keep trying to challenge my perspective to see what I'm doing wrong, I'm told I'm a great communicator, I'm even told I'm hard-working but it never seems to fucking amount to anything significant and I'm still disappointed I can't have a normal fucking life. I'm pissed that I have no normal family dynamic, people to depend on, and that I had no fucking support for the cancer from ""friends"" all the same who never bothered to ask me about it or offer to just be around. I'm tired of the most recent series of relationships(friendships and dating) I'm putting myself out there to make, and despite things going well for months on end, with deep conversations and trying to be a healthy support for them, they withdraw or ghost me in the end. And in doing the extra legwork to see if I'm doing something wrong in finding a happenstance to talk to them, its apparently not my fault and I'm such a great friend/support/ect they just don't want the responsibility with the relationship at the time. So why'd you fucking make the commitment? Is this really my fucking punishment of trying to be the ""right"" person? To be positive, supportive, and not burden you with my own bullshit? To try and assume the best of someone? I just get the social rug pulled under me? I'm never going to amount to shit and I feel like serve no fucking personal meaning to anyone in the end. I haven't had a fucking holiday with anyone in over 6 years, and this Easter is just another weight.

The suicide hotline was a weird experience,"The first volunteer I spoke to didn't help me and kept telling me to try meditation. When I told her that while I can't center myself during meditation and find myself thinking clearly when I run, I don't think these coping mechanisms give me any hope in life. She started to yell at me judging meditation and began defending it because it would help her.

I cut the call.

The second volunteer told me that there are other people with more valid suicidal thoughts that he'd rather help.

I said 'thank you for your time' and cut the call.

The third volunteer sounded like someone who was younger. I don't say that as a judgment but he really listened to me for three hours. He began to crack at the end of hour three and I heard him start to cry. He asked if I would be ok with him transferring the call to another volunteer or supervisor.

His reaction was perhaps the most genuine interaction I've had in a while. I tried consoling him because, not only was he sincere, he gave me the opportunity to feel like what I said mattered.

I said thank you and cut the call.

I have been sitting in my balcony for hours, ready to jump. But I don't know how to look at this world now.

Even at my most vulnerable, I had to deal with two assholes (who should gargle cacti) , but at the same time, the third guy made me feel less lonely than I've felt in years.

Non-Suicidal People Don't Get It,"People around me who don't struggle with suicidal thoughts always say all the wrong things to try to convince me to want to live. The most common example of this is when they try to use missing me as a good argument. That's the most triggering thing for me, and it makes me want to tell them, ""Yeah, that's exactly the reason why I'm in anguish over feeling this way."" The only real reason I've kept going all this time is because I'm afraid of being selfish and making others pay for my mistakes (financially and emotionally). I can't win in a situation where if I go others will be in pain, but if I stay I'll be the one in pain.

note to my dad,"Hey don't know if this can be posted here and not sure why I am even putting it up but I guess I wanted to see if people thought I was blaming my dad in this note or if I wasn't owning up to my failures. I want to try and explain everything I am currently feeling to him when I eventually send it to him. I also understand that I may get comments saying suicide isn't an option and you have so much to live for etc. I appreciate the words of encouragement but would like any questions or comments be in regards to the letter and not suicide.

I don't deserve any sort of response and I don't know why I am bothering you but I don't have anyone else really besides some friends who I would fear judging me for being weak and pathetic.

This past week I found out that I am a very unhealthy person. Wednesday 04/05/23 was the start of my down spiral and plans were made and then weighed for practicality. Oddly enough I ended up deciding on VSED which never would have been possible anyways since as time past I would be incapable of preventing an emt from providing iv fluids. But out of my available options I figured it was the potentially least scarring for anya to see. Although I know no matter what it would increase her risk I was hopeful that she would be too young to remember me. I didnt drink or eat anything for roughly 50 hours.

On Friday 04/07/23 I decided to see if someone could potentially change my mind so I sent a message to my psychiatrist and also called 988. In all honesty 988 did nothing to help they seem to enjoy saying the same thing over and over. ""I can understand you are in a lot of pain."" Blah blah blah.

Still under the assumption both Rachel and Anya would have an easier time without me I was dead set on following through. Knowing that I would eventually collapse from dehydration I texted Rachel explaining that we were over and that I was leaving. I planned to withdraw $400 in cash from a random atm and find a motel or hotel to stay in for a few nights.

I proceeded to get dressed(been working from home) and prepared to leave when Rachel got home. We ended up talking and we figured out a way to potentially save our marriage. I dont think its my place to discuss what we have decided on. I am willing to do and try anything if it will make her happy. But i am not sure if it will work and if it doesn't I have every intention of going through with the VSED which is a ""super healthy"" reaction to divorce but I have no desire of fighting for custody for my daughter and as I said earlier she is young enough to potentially forget me. I also have no idea who or what I am without her which is also ""super healthy.""

My psychiatrist is currently looking for a therapist for me and it will most likely take a few months or so for me to figure out if I am OK or not with this new dynamic amd decide on what to do.

The psychiatrist I am seeing is part of a program to perform ect so that could also happen soon. That might help. I have been on 4 or 5 different antidepressants in the past 7 or 8 months trying to find something that is effective. Granted I know I haven't been doing it right since I should also include talk therapy with it but I've always found it annoying to talk to somebody about the feelings I have successfully repressed in an attempt to feel nothing.

Oddly enough texting my feelings is a bit easier not sure why, probably due to my ADHD that let's me just ramble on. 

It is a bit odd the clarity and freedom I feel knowing that I might die in a few months. I don't think I would have been able to text you under any other circumstance besides I guess a farewell note. 

I don't know why our relationship is the way it is. Maybe I was always searching for some type of motherly love due to the failed relationships I had with my foster mother and biological mother. And because of that I attempted to enter into any type of relationship with a woman to the detriment of myself and those around me. Going so far as to push away eveyone. Or I could just be an asshole who is stubborn and refuses to admit he is wrong. Maybe a little bit of both.

I don't know if you regret adopting me, but I am very appreciative of the chance you took on me even if in the end it resulted in you being hurt. I will say that I was very hurt when you refused to go to Anyas birthday party. I know but don't think I understand the issues you had with Gail. But at the time Rachel and I were flat broke and even having a birthday party for my daughter was stretching our finances dangerously thin, think we failed to pay the electric that month. I would have preferred to have it at your house but it was under construction and since it was going to  rain we couldn't have it outside like we had planned. I tried texting you a few times after you said you wouldn't be able to make it, but got no response so I assumed you cut me out. Which I guess was latter reinforced when Rachel texted you about Anya and I getting into an accident that totaled the car and gave me a concussion but we didn't get any response.

I am not trying to place any blame or anything as in the end none of it really matters. What's done is done and sometimes there is nothing we can do to change the results. I am a pretty selfish and manipulative person I have a very hard time telling the truth even to myself and because of that I always look to get as much as I can out of anyone and any situation. I like to think I have changed in the past year or so by trying to be more open and honest about my shortcomings and fears. I'm not sure why I was or possibly still am like that. I don't know if it's just who I am, or if I learned it in foster care. I am not blaming my failures on foster care because if I truly wanted to I could have learned to stop it and change myself. You gave me many opportunities in order for me to do that and maybe it took until I was a father for it to really sink in that I needed to change.

I know they say that suicide is a forever solution to a temporary problem and it isn't really a choice but running away. It's hard to see it that way. Even going beyond the survivors guilt I still feel and has gotten worse since Anya is around the same age as JJ was. The depression alone has not been a temporary problem seeing as I feel like I've had depression since I was 4. Even on medication and talk therapy I don't think I ever felt truly free of my depression. Therefore maybe suicide is a permanent solution to a permanent problem.

But I digress I wanted to write this and just say I am sorry that despite every opportunity and chance you gave I just slapped your hand away. You didn't deserve that and I apologize for it.

I racked up 60 hours of sick leave at my job,"I work in a union so they're lenient. 

I have a lot of mental illness. A lot. I was very heavily abused as a child, it happened well into my 20s and I just got out of an abusive relationship recently. (All of which is physically, mentally and sexually) 

I'm currently in therapy and have an appointment with a psychiatrist in a few days to get me on meds. I have schizoaffective disorder and a handful of other things. 

My best friend passed away recently, followed by another one of my very close friends. Both of which saved me by helping me in different ways and as you can imagine I don't really have family to turn too. 

My mental health is fucked. 

My therapist is pushing for disability but it takes ages and a lot of paperwork. I'm living in a one bedroom with my abuser and trying to escape. I'm getting a new place hopefully next months but until than

I'm trapped. 

Work is nightmare times for me. So many people. Their voices gargle. Their eyes change. Their faces distort. The world isn't real. I don't even know if I'm xcureently real. 

I'm always seconds from panic at work but than I go home and it's not better but I can get high and I can distract myself at least. This is a double edge sword too. Sometimes the high makes my mental Illness worse. It'll give me flash backs. Etc 

I'm at my limit. 

My work sees this. They see I'm bat shit insane. I'm working on getting paperwork drawn up and submitted to excuse my absences but now I can't call out of work. 

I can't leave. 

I have to suffer through whatever my brain decides and sometimes it's scary. Hanging bodies. Screaming voices. People telling me to hurt myself. Cut off my hands. My ears. Take out my eyes. 

I just want peace. I was written up for leaving and calling out so much today and next step is suspension. If I lose my job I lose my insurance. I can't eat. I've eaten once in two days. I can't sleep it's nightmares. All the time. My nightmares have nightmares. 

I don't know what to do! If this new psychiatrist can't help me get disability I don't know any other form of peace. 
Who am I even. Who cares? Maybe I'm not real and I'm a fictional character in someone's book. I like to pretend I am sometimes. But that only helps so much when I'm being tortured with hunger and nightmares in the daytime.",Bernardposting,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12gzmcs/i_racked_up_60_hours_of_sick_leave_at_my_job/,work union lenient lot mental illness lot wa heavily abused child happened well 20 got abusive relationship recently physically mentally sexually currently therapy appointment psychiatrist day get med schizoaffective disorder handful thing best friend passed away recently followed another one close friend saved helping different way imagine really family turn mental health fucked therapist pushing disability take age lot paperwork living one bedroom abuser trying escape getting new place hopefully next month trapped work nightmare time many people voice gargle eye change face distort world real even know xcureently real always second panic work go home better get high distract least double edge sword sometimes high make mental illness worse give flash back etc limit work see see bat shit insane working getting paperwork drawn submitted excuse absence call work leave suffer whatever brain decides sometimes scary hanging body screaming voice people telling hurt cut hand ear take eye want peace wa written leaving calling much today next step suspension lose job lose insurance eat eaten two day sleep nightmare time nightmare nightmare know new psychiatrist help get disability know form peace even care maybe real fictional character someone book like pretend sometimes help much tortured hunger nightmare daytime,racked 60 hour sick leave job,bernard posting
Constantly being compared to my twin makes me suicidal,"He’s everything that I’m not. Successful, in school with fantastic grades (even made honor society), scholarships, lots of friends, a social life, a good job, etc.

And what the fuck am I? I failed out of college, I have no friends, no social life; I hate my shit ass job making minimum wage and get harassed every fucking day by entitled customers.

Every fucking family gathering I have to listen to how proud my parents are of him. Don’t get me wrong, I’m proud of him too. But he’s everything that I’m not. I’m the fuck up. My parents boast about him, but if anyone asks about me, I know they’re too embarrassed to say I’ve accomplished nothing. It’s always been that way. He’s been better at everything since we were kids. He did better at sports, music, grades, video games. Everything. I’m obsolete. They don’t need me here. I just want to fucking die.

Note to my dad,"Hey don't know if this can be posted here and not sure why I am even putting it up but I guess I wanted to see if people thought I was blaming my dad in this note or if I wasn't owning up to my failures. I want to try and explain everything I am currently feeling to him when I eventually send it to him. I also understand that I may get comments saying suicide isn't an option and you have so much to live for etc. I appreciate the words of encouragement but would like any questions or comments be in regards to the letter and not suicide.

I don't deserve any sort of response and I don't know why I am bothering you but I don't have anyone else really besides some friends who I would fear judging me for being weak and pathetic.

This past week I found out that I am a very unhealthy person. Wednesday 04/05/23 was the start of my down spiral and plans were made and then weighed for practicality. Oddly enough I ended up deciding on VSED which never would have been possible anyways since as time past I would be incapable of preventing an emt from providing iv fluids. But out of my available options I figured it was the potentially least scarring for anya to see. Although I know no matter what it would increase her risk I was hopeful that she would be too young to remember me. I didnt drink or eat anything for roughly 50 hours.

On Friday 04/07/23 I decided to see if someone could potentially change my mind so I sent a message to my psychiatrist and also called 988. In all honesty 988 did nothing to help they seem to enjoy saying the same thing over and over. ""I can understand you are in a lot of pain."" Blah blah blah.

Still under the assumption both Rachel and Anya would have an easier time without me I was dead set on following through. Knowing that I would eventually collapse from dehydration I texted Rachel explaining that we were over and that I was leaving. I planned to withdraw $400 in cash from a random atm and find a motel or hotel to stay in for a few nights.

I proceeded to get dressed(been working from home) and prepared to leave when Rachel got home. We ended up talking and we figured out a way to potentially save our marriage. I dont think its my place to discuss what we have decided on. I am willing to do and try anything if it will make her happy. But i am not sure if it will work and if it doesn't I have every intention of going through with the VSED which is a ""super healthy"" reaction to divorce but I have no desire of fighting for custody for my daughter and as I said earlier she is young enough to potentially forget me. I also have no idea who or what I am without her which is also ""super healthy.""

My psychiatrist is currently looking for a therapist for me and it will most likely take a few months or so for me to figure out if I am OK or not with this new dynamic amd decide on what to do.

The psychiatrist I am seeing is part of a program to perform ect so that could also happen soon. That might help. I have been on 4 or 5 different antidepressants in the past 7 or 8 months trying to find something that is effective. Granted I know I haven't been doing it right since I should also include talk therapy with it but I've always found it annoying to talk to somebody about the feelings I have successfully repressed in an attempt to feel nothing.

Oddly enough texting my feelings is a bit easier not sure why, probably due to my ADHD that let's me just ramble on. 

It is a bit odd the clarity and freedom I feel knowing that I might die in a few months. I don't think I would have been able to text you under any other circumstance besides I guess a farewell note. 

I don't know why our relationship is the way it is. Maybe I was always searching for some type of motherly love due to the failed relationships I had with my foster mother and biological mother. And because of that I attempted to enter into any type of relationship with a woman to the detriment of myself and those around me. Going so far as to push away eveyone. Or I could just be an asshole who is stubborn and refuses to admit he is wrong. Maybe a little bit of both.

I don't know if you regret adopting me, but I am very appreciative of the chance you took on me even if in the end it resulted in you being hurt. I will say that I was very hurt when you refused to go to Anyas birthday party. I know but don't think I understand the issues you had with Gail. But at the time Rachel and I were flat broke and even having a birthday party for my daughter was stretching our finances dangerously thin, think we failed to pay the electric that month. I would have preferred to have it at your house but it was under construction and since it was going to  rain we couldn't have it outside like we had planned. I tried texting you a few times after you said you wouldn't be able to make it, but got no response so I assumed you cut me out. Which I guess was latter reinforced when Rachel texted you about Anya and I getting into an accident that totaled the car and gave me a concussion but we didn't get any response.

I am not trying to place any blame or anything as in the end none of it really matters. What's done is done and sometimes there is nothing we can do to change the results. I am a pretty selfish and manipulative person I have a very hard time telling the truth even to myself and because of that I always look to get as much as I can out of anyone and any situation. I like to think I have changed in the past year or so by trying to be more open and honest about my shortcomings and fears. I'm not sure why I was or possibly still am like that. I don't know if it's just who I am, or if I learned it in foster care. I am not blaming my failures on foster care because if I truly wanted to I could have learned to stop it and change myself. You gave me many opportunities in order for me to do that and maybe it took until I was a father for it to really sink in that I needed to change.

I know they say that suicide is a forever solution to a temporary problem and it isn't really a choice but running away. It's hard to see it that way. Even going beyond the survivors guilt I still feel and has gotten worse since Anya is around the same age as JJ was. The depression alone has not been a temporary problem seeing as I feel like I've had depression since I was 4. Even on medication and talk therapy I don't think I ever felt truly free of my depression. Therefore maybe suicide is a permanent solution to a permanent problem.

But I digress I wanted to write this and just say I am sorry that despite every opportunity and chance you gave I just slapped your hand away. You didn't deserve that and I apologize for it. I don't know if I will send this now or wait till a few months later but I will send it to you once I figure out if this is truly a suicide note or just something to throw in the trash bin.",Hour_Ad1909,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12h84en/note_to_my_dad/,hey know posted sure even putting guess wanted see people thought wa blaming dad note owning failure want try explain everything currently feeling eventually send also understand may get comment saying suicide option much live etc appreciate word encouragement would like question comment regard letter suicide deserve sort response know bothering anyone else really besides friend would fear judging weak pathetic past week found unhealthy person wednesday 04 05 23 wa start spiral plan made weighed practicality oddly enough ended deciding vsed never would possible anyways since time past would incapable preventing emt providing iv fluid available option figured wa potentially least scarring anya see although know matter would increase risk wa hopeful would young remember didnt drink eat anything roughly 50 hour friday 04 07 23 decided see someone could potentially change mind sent message psychiatrist also called 988 honesty 988 nothing help seem enjoy saying thing understand lot pain blah blah blah still assumption rachel anya would easier time without wa dead set following knowing would eventually collapse dehydration texted rachel explaining wa leaving planned withdraw 400 cash random atm find motel hotel stay night proceeded get dressed working home prepared leave rachel got home ended talking figured way potentially save marriage dont think place discus decided willing try anything make happy sure work every intention going vsed super healthy reaction divorce desire fighting custody daughter said earlier young enough potentially forget also idea without also super healthy psychiatrist currently looking therapist likely take month figure ok new dynamic amd decide psychiatrist seeing part program perform ect could also happen soon might help 4 5 different antidepressant past 7 8 month trying find something effective granted know right since also include talk therapy always found annoying talk somebody feeling successfully repressed attempt feel nothing oddly enough texting feeling bit easier sure probably due adhd let ramble bit odd clarity freedom feel knowing might die month think would able text circumstance besides guess farewell note know relationship way maybe wa always searching type motherly love due failed relationship foster mother biological mother attempted enter type relationship woman detriment around going far push away eveyone could asshole stubborn refuse admit wrong maybe little bit know regret adopting appreciative chance took even end resulted hurt say wa hurt refused go anyas birthday party know think understand issue gail time rachel flat broke even birthday party daughter wa stretching finance dangerously thin think failed pay electric month would preferred house wa construction since wa going rain outside like planned tried texting time said able make got response assumed cut guess wa latter reinforced rachel texted anya getting accident totaled car gave concussion get response trying place blame anything end none really matter done done sometimes nothing change result pretty selfish manipulative person hard time telling truth even always look get much anyone situation like think changed past year trying open honest shortcoming fear sure wa possibly still like know learned foster care blaming failure foster care truly wanted could learned stop change gave many opportunity order maybe took wa father really sink needed change know say suicide forever solution temporary problem really choice running away hard see way even going beyond survivor guilt still feel ha gotten worse since anya around age jj wa depression alone ha temporary problem seeing feel like depression since wa 4 even medication talk therapy think ever felt truly free depression therefore maybe suicide permanent solution permanent problem digress wanted write say sorry despite every opportunity chance gave slapped hand away deserve apologize know send wait till month later send figure truly suicide note something throw trash bin,note dad,hour ad 1909

I have yet again lost someone I deeply cared about,"I have met a girl on Tinder in November and she was Swedish, she completely toyed with me and ended up just using me for attention until she got fed up, ghosted me and eventually blocked me. I am 22 years old and never had a genuine connection with a girl and with every shitty experience my pit of despair becomes a little deeper. Since I am currently writing my bachelor thesis and had to look for a place for my Masters I decided I might go to Sweden (don't fucking ask me why). I started learning Swedish and on a language learning app I met a Swedish girl (January). We started talking a lot, had multiple hour phone calls and if one were to read our texts one would have thought we were boyfriend and girlfriend. My bachelor thesis is going terribly and has taken a huge toll on my mental health. The prospect of meeting her is what kept me going. We talked a lot about meeting each other and I booked a flight to come meet her in June. (This was in March) a week later she freaked out and told me to  cancel. I told her I did (I did not, since I would have gotten no money back so cancelling or not taking the flight would be the same result). We agreed to just be friends, however after a few days she started to act affectionate with me again and when I was drunk I asked her what was going on and she said she wanted to be more than friends.

Last week I was rejected by the Swedish universities. It appeared as everything was completely fine between us. I told her last week that I did not actually cancel the flight and that if she wants to we could still meet,she said yes. 

Tonight she told me we need to talk about me coming over and essentially said she does not have a romantic interest in me and I only made her feel special and she did not want to lose that. I told ber how much this hurts as this is now the second time she did this to me and how I told her about all my trauma and why she did all of this despite knowing this. She just straight up blocked me.

I don't know what to do anymore. I have no master spot, my bachelor is going terribly and the one person who has been my anchor through out 2023 has cut me out like I meant nothing and every single time I think I met a person who could be my girlfriend it ends with a world of hurt.

I started the process of legally changing my name today.,"Tldr; Birth name holds trauma. After 8 years of using what my ""new"" name will be, I finally was able to file the petition to change it. I'm emotional and over the moon. 

I've disliked my birth name for the majority of my life. My brother's have planned, honor names. I was supposed to have a planned name, too. My bio father decided to wait till after I was born to tell my mom that, because of his stutter, he couldn't say my intended name. Thus, I was given a quickly picked baby book name. My father left maybe a year later. 

That coupled with other unsavory factors as a child with my name, and being genderqueer, I have a lot of deep and negative feelings for my dead name. 

I have gone by my ""new"" name socially for 8 years now. I've dealt with my internal turmoil cause I rarely had to interact with my legal one. That is until I started back to college this year. 

I hear and see it everywhere. I have to say and write it constantly. I tried to be okay and deal with it but every instance feels like nails on a chalkboard.

I never pursued changing it before because the process is lengthy and very expensive. But I couldn't take it anymore, and I managed to find an affidavit to wave the filing and newspaper paper publication. 

I wasn't sure if I would get approved, and considering I wouldn't be able to afford it if not, I did my best to not get excited. 

Today I went to file the paperwork. My waiver was approved, and my petition has been filed. There are more steps still, but this is in motion now. 

I'm overwhelmed with emotions. I'm so thankful I was approved, happy that I finally get to do this, and relieved to be rid of that other name. 

It hasn't quite set in yet and I still want to cry.

I pushed myself out of my comfort zone and started a business!,"I always wanted to be an artist but never been confident enough to put myself out there. I’ve had depression and anxiety for well over 10 years now and it’s been crippling. I have survived an abusive relationship and lots of bad luck in life but I didn’t want that to define me. So the stubborn part of me kept going to prove that despite what the world seems to think I’m not broken and I’m not worthless. 

Today I got my first commission and I’m so excited. It’s only a little job but if you’d told me a year ago this is what I’d be doing now I’d have just laughed. It’s the first job I’ve got and it’s hopefully going to get my little business off the ground.

I'm finally making progress in my war against depression and I'm loving it,"For the last 5 or so years I've been in a constant battle with depression and I let it hold me back so much that I felt like I wasted my 20's (I'm 26 now). I had kind of accepted that I was gonna just be miserable all the time and I realized that I was holding onto my depression, not the other way around. I haven't had any confidence in myself after a series of huge failures, and I was just dwelling on those failures. I also realized that I don't ***know*** myself. I don't know what ***I*** like, everything I've done has been to establish an image for myself. But it wasn't ME. I thought it was, and that's why I didn't believe in myself cause even the things I thought I liked were making me miserable. So I said enough is enough, I'm gonna do what I want to do for no other reason than I want to. Not to create an image of how I want people to see me. And this week I've taken my first steps into finding ME.

So this week I stepped out of my comfort zone and decided to do something that I can feel a sense of accomplishment about. I started learning a second language, German. I had tried to learn Russian a few years back but I gave up after a week or so. But I got a notification randomly from Duolingo so I said Screw It and dove head first into German, and it's going great. My only REAL motivation is that I want to visit my family's town in Bavaria and would like to be able to communicate when I do go. But other than that, it's just something I've never done and decided to dive into with no expectations. But it's amazing what it's done for my mental health! I feel good when I get a sentence right or finish a lesson with no mistakes, I feel GOOD. I haven't said that in years. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then I took a huge step and applied for a second job. I've only ever worked for my family's business, it's a desk job in an office in a shop on the same property as my wife and I's house. My whole existence takes place within about 1 square mile, and it was killing me. The pay is good, and the hours are flexible, but I felt no accomplishment. But I've always wanted to work on cars. I never thought I'd do it as a career but always wanted to, I just never believed I could do it. I love tinkering with things, working with my hands, and I love cars. So on a whim yesterday I applied for a part time job at a mechanics shop near me. No real expectations, as I've applied for probably 10 different jobs over the years and never gotten one because they assume I'm overqualified based on my current job. Which sucked cause even if I am as far as skills, I WANT to do something else. I didn't need a second job financially, my wife and I live comfortably with our two incomes, but I needed something new in my life and something that I can be proud of. So, this Friday I have an interview! The only other time I've done an interview was for an intern position at a recording studio (music has been my passion for the last 16 years) but didn't get the job (one of my big ""failures"" in life). I'm nervous, not about the interview but about doing something new. I know it'll be good for me, and I know I'll love it, it's just that I'm stepping out of my comfort zone in a way I never had before. 

&amp;#x200B;

"Is adult life lonely, or have I built walls?","I'd like to preface this post with some reassurance - I live a \*very\* happy life. I've got a stable job in an industry I love with conditions that allow me to pursue hobbies, projects, and to take care of my mental health. I'm still living a socially fulfilling life too - rare are the evenings I spend on my own!

But the more I look back, the more I notice that I've been losing a lot of relationships I felt very passionate and strongly about over the years - way more than the ones I've had the chance to build. I feel like I've been struggling to be invested and passionate about people the way I used to be when I was in my late teens / early adult life - though it's only been a handful of years. There's a lot under that rug though, so I won't pull it up if you don't ask!

The same seems to be true for crushes and love: what used to be butterflies for many different people per year has now turned to my last love interest having happened about two years ago. Again, there's monsters under that bed, but I've grown not to fear them anymore.

I've been thinking over this a lot lately. I'm just not sure if they're concerns or if it's only natural as years go by and as my responsibilities and routine change that my relations and habits around people change as well, or maybe if it's just how most people grow as they reach and develop into adulthood.

Do you relate? Is this a challenge you've lived as well? Are there alarms and signals I could be ignoring? Or is there a peace of mind I haven't been exposed to that I've secretly gained, some sort of silver lining?",MinisTendencies,10,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/12k40zr/is_adult_life_lonely_or_have_i_built_walls/,like preface post reassurance live happy life got stable job industry love condition allow pursue hobby project take care mental health still living socially fulfilling life rare evening spend look back notice losing lot relationship felt passionate strongly year way one chance build feel like struggling invested passionate people way used wa late teen early adult life though handful year lot rug though pull ask seems true crush love used butterfly many different people per year ha turned last love interest happened two year ago monster bed grown fear anymore thinking lot lately sure concern natural year go responsibility routine change relation habit around people change well maybe people grow reach develop adulthood relate challenge lived well alarm signal could ignoring peace mind exposed secretly gained sort silver lining,adult life lonely built wall,mini tendency

idk, just something thats been on my mind and was wondering what others opinions could be.

Stranger Cheered Me Up!,"Stranger lifting mood!

I just had to share a story about a small act of kindness that had a huge impact on my day. I was having one of those rough days where nothing seemed to go right – I overslept, spilled coffee on myself, and even missed an important meeting. By the time I reached the bus stop, I was on the verge of tears, feeling completely overwhelmed.

As I stood there waiting for the bus, a kind stranger noticed my distress and offered me a warm smile. They then struck up a friendly conversation, asking me about my day and sharing a few funny anecdotes to cheer me up. It was such a simple gesture, but it made all the difference. Before I knew it, my mood had lifted, and I felt so much lighter.

The bus arrived, and as we parted ways, the stranger patted me on the back and said, ""Remember, there's always a silver lining, and tomorrow is a new day!"" Their words stuck with me, and I felt a renewed sense of optimism. I'm incredibly grateful for that stranger's kindness and the reminder that we all have the power to brighten someone's day with a few kind words.

Best Assumption Ever!!!,"Brooooooo....!!!

I am a 31 year old woman. I've been aware of my attraction to girls/women since high school. I identified as bi for a while, though I've only ever dated guys. I now identify as queer (idk, the term just feels cozy to me).

On these dreaded dating sites, I swipe right on so many women. Sooooo mannnnyyyy womeeeeennnnn.... but I'm basically invisible to all of them. I get some overinflated amount of interest from guys, and once in a blue moon, a girl would swipe right on me, and leave tumbleweed in the chat. 

In public, I've only ever caught the eyes of men. I don't dress ""girly"" at all--I hate dresses and skirts, but I guess I'm curvy, and that's apparently a dude magnet? Idk. Since I'm genuinely attracted to guys, I return their interest because it's easy and I've been doing it for years. I've kissed women before, but never dated one ever.

Today, I was talking to someone (or rather, she was talking AT me), and she said some version of the following:

&gt;You know how it is with your man... or your woman... I don't know what your preference is, I honestly think you might be gay!

Am I a brown-noser or is it work envy/jealousy?,"I am an extrovert, through and through. I love people, a lot. Genuinely I do. I admire people for many different things as well and I do tend to compliment people, with genuine compliments, regularly because I like to see the smile on people's faces.

I started this new job almost a year and a half ago. I'm naturally pretty good at what I do, things make sense, things click. So, my boss has assigned me new things and allowed me to take on tasks. I actually like my boss, I think she's good at her job and very good at being diplomatic. She notified us a month ago that she's retiring (2 months from then). It was then found out that I'll be taking over some of the roles she was doing, new processes that are new to the entire team. 

Today, a co-worker asked me to look at something with her so I went to her desk to look it over. She had her teams messenger up on the other screen and on it, a conversation with a supervisor (not my supervisor, but there's only 2 supervisors at our small office). In this conversation they were talking about how I'm a brown noser, I've been dressing up a lot lately and they wonder what that's all about (we have a business casual code,I literally wore jeans with a sport coat yesterday and today I wore black slacks with a business style shirt. I'm horrible at fashion so I'm honestly kind of excited when an outfit looks nice), how I think I'm special because I'm doing some of ""the big man's"" work, and how she's frustrated that I got the assignment and she wasn't considered.

I know, I shouldn't have even read it but saw my name and it was right there on the screen for 15 minutes before she realized it and minimized it.

Honestly, had this conversation been between two co-workers,I wouldn't have cared so much. But, it was between a co-worker and someone who is supposed to be my superior. That irritates me because I do want to grow in my career and I do not want something like this affecting that.

So, I do not think I'm a brown noser, I do not ever go out of my way for anyone specifically at work. I'll help out when asked, regardless of who it is. But maybe I am? How do I know? 

And, if you were in my shoes, what would you do? Currently I don't intend to do anything other than keep that conversation in mind.

"I re-watched the movie ""Jurassic World"" a few weeks ago &amp; I feel nostalgic for it and am sad :(","As a kid who grew up watching l three Jurassic Park movies despite not being a kid in the 1990s I did enjoy watching them a lot as a kid, mostly because one of my special interests at the time was Dinosaur's &amp; the Jurassic Park movies happened to be about them lol. 

I loved Watching the Jurassic Park movies as a kid, despite not growing up in the 90s it was because I had a special interest with dinosaurs. So when I heard that there would be a ""Jurassic Park 4"" I got pretty excited, I remember all the trailers &amp; news about the movie that came out before it released, especially that Awesome viral marketing websites that were made for the movie I.E the JurassicWorld.com website that acted as a fake ARG-type website for the Jurassic World resort on Isla Nublar, sadly it's not active anymore but we also got MasraniGlobal.com which had some very interesting information on it talking about the origins of the park &amp; what happened between Jurassic Park 3 and Jurassic World. So in preparation to re-watch the movie I decided to check out both sites again with some help from the way back machine and also played the Lego game again.

Eventually when the movie released me &amp; my family went to see it in theathers and I remembered walking out satisfied with what I go but also found some of the complaints about the movie to be a bit weird &amp; confusing personally speaking, but anyways I couldn't wait to see what came next. To sorta left my special interest phase about Dinosaurs eventually, but due to nostalgia reasons I decided to watch the movie again &amp; I still think it's decent and ages well. But I do have some thing to say about it, both positive and negative:

- Positives: 

- Visually I thought the movie looked incredible! The CGI on the Dinosaurs looks photorealistic at points, although that's to be expected as ILM were the people who did the CGI for the movie. But I also thought the animatronic puppets used were of high quality as well, apparently the Raptors when there in the ""mussel cages"" were animatronic puppets &amp; apparently during Filming Bryce Dallas Howard actually got genuinely emotional during the scene where the apatosaurus dies as the animatronic puppet used was very life-like to her. 

- I think that the production team did an ABSOLUTELY AMAZING job with making Jurassic World look &amp; feel-like a real theme park and resort that you could visit IRL, it kinda makes me want to visit it.

- I thought the movie had some cool concepts that were executed well such as the ""I.B.R.I.S"" Velociraptors in the movie &amp; the I-Rex as a whole were cool to watch, some of them were original ideas while others were either taken from the Novels that the movies were based on (The I-Rex Camouflaging is a reference to The Lost World novels Camouflaging Carnotaurus) or came from other sources, such as how the I-Rex being a hybrid was taken from the ""chaos effect"" toyline from the 90s.

- Most of the actors give good performances in the movie, even if there isn't much to them as people personally speaking. But they all play their parts well &amp; I wasn't really asking for deep complex characters from a drama flick in a Jurassic Park movie. But I do think that some of the protagonists stand out &amp; I didn’t have much to say about the movie’s antagonists “Hoskins” played by Vincent  Vincent D'Onofrio as he’s basically just a satirical take on the people who fuel the military industrial complex.

- You cannot go wrong with Irfan Khan, the guy is extremely charming &amp; likable in this movie to where I actually got kinda sad when his character died, especially since he’s sadly gone from us as he was also very likable and charming IRL :(

- I Liked seeing the Dinosaur’s just being themselves in the movie &amp; especially seeing the original T-Rex “Rexy” back again, I still get chills seeing her walk out of her enclosure towards the flare where she then attacks the I-Rex and it’s just nice to see her again :)

- I also think the movies is very well paced, but could have used some more scenes that I wish weren’t removed.

- I liked how the movie took itself fairly seriously from start to finish &amp; even had some mildly gory death scenes which I’m surprised that they got away with. It’s very in-line with what we got in the previous movies. Like I remember my little sister got traumatized watching this in theaters, especially when the character Zara died.

- the soundtrack by Micheal Gichino is pretty good to listen too, &amp; I still listen to it at points.

- I though the satirical commentary about how the I-Rex is basically a metaphor for Hollywood capitalism I thought was clever as it basically attacks &amp; goes around killing the dinosaurs &amp; was was only created to be a short term spectacle, which is reminiscent of Hollywood studios basically changing something to where it’s seemingly unrecognizable from what it originally was for short term monetary profits. But it also adds some complexity to the I-Rex as it never asked to be born and was pretty much made to be a spectacle which is a bit tragic.

All in all there’s a lot I liked about the movie, but now I’ll discuss some things I didn’t like. Which luckily isn’t as big as this list.

Negatives:

- There was a Deleted scene involving the two boys that would have happened when they end up finding the old visitor center &amp; walk into the garage with the old jeeps, where they basically would have just sat down/relaxed as they’d been chased around up until that point in the movie, where they would have talked and that whole divorcement storyline would have been addressed to where the little kid “grey” would have talked about how he was excited for this trap because he thinks this is one of the last times he would have gotten to interact with his brother as they would have been separated due to there parents divorcing, &amp; how grey was “annoying” his older brother Zach because he just wanted to spend time with him and not just be alone and away from him for the rest of his life. Which could have caused Zach to go through a character change, which would have given him a motivation to fix up the old Jeep so they can escape back to the park. I wish this was kept in as it would have been a nice quieter part f the movie focused on the characters. Also it would explain where Al the random water puddles in the parks main street would have came from as it would be raining in the scene for ambient effect. Not to mention it would have acted as foreshadowing to the ending of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, as during there conversation Grey would have said something along the lines of “so this is what a world with dinosaurs would be like? People who are worried &amp; scared about what will happen.” 

- I thought the movie had a few moments that I feel felt a bit forced, such as the I-Rex realizing the tracker the staff put inside her was actually a tracking device, like I can buy the idea that she could feel it &amp; would remove it from herself if she felt annoyed by it, but I don’t know how she would as easily come to the conclusion that it was being used to track her.

Overall that’s what I think about the movie, I enjoyed my time watching it &amp; would probably watch it again at some point if I felt like it. I hope you guys appreciate my “analysis” of sorts haha 😛. Although I’m a bit worried that I might get lots of flak from people who don’t appreciate my opinion that much.

One time when I was a kid my mom caught me listening to explicit music so she confiscated my iPod and video games for two weeks and I started crying so hard that I threw up and passed out,I dunno what my deal was but that was really dramatic.

Does anyone have an experience of living with their much younger siblings?,"Long story short:

When I (23F) was 15 my parents sent me to study abroad. I've finished high school here, and currently doing my master's in uni + working full-time a corporate job. I live alone and I'm super used to it ngl.

My parents plan on sending my younger brother to study here as well next year. And naturally I'm going to take care of him, we're gonna live together and all.

I'll be 24 and he'll be 15.

I feel kinda bad for taking it as a bit of a burden (I'll JUST get out of uni, my free 20s...🥲). But that's family so it is how it is. I do love him and my little sister a lot, it's just hard to imagine taking responsibility for him to such extent. 

But then again, 15 is not that young, he could take care of himself. My parents will definitely be on alert, sustaining him financially, parenting him and all.

It can also be a big opportunity for me to finally really befried him, yk? Like, watching anime together sounds fun! 

But then I remember myself at that age and oof... first times drinking, partying, getting into trouble.... i went off the rails fast since I was abroad alone with no supervision. And I'm the diligent one....
Idk how I'll handle it if my baby brother gets into this teenage rebel stage. 

And so yeah. I was wondering if anyone had similar experiences? Or perhaps parents who raised teenage kids have some experience? That's not to say my parents will shift raising him onto me, for sure that's not the case but I can tell I'll be very involved.",ortary,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/12jrwlb/does_anyone_have_an_experience_of_living_with/,long story short 23f wa 15 parent sent study abroad finished high school currently master uni working full time corporate job live alone super used ngl parent plan sending younger brother study well next year naturally going take care gonna live together 24 15 feel kinda bad taking bit burden get uni free 20 family love little sister lot hard imagine taking responsibility extent 15 young could take care parent definitely alert sustaining financially parenting also big opportunity finally really befried yk like watching anime together sound fun remember age oof first time drinking partying getting trouble went rail fast since wa abroad alone supervision diligent one idk handle baby brother get teenage rebel stage yeah wa wondering anyone similar experience perhaps parent raised teenage kid experience say parent shift raising onto sure case tell involved,doe anyone experience living much younger sibling,tar

"My parents get better at parenting the less I talk to them, its weird","My mom was a terrible mom to me growing up. There was a huge discrepancy in the way she treated me vs my siblings. My sister agrees that i am my moms least favorite. Growing up nothing I did was right in my mom's eyes. I wasn't walking right, my stride was too manly. I couldn't sit right because i tend to sway unconsciously. I was a terrible student because i didn't study right despite straight As. I was lazy because I liked to lay in bed and read after school even though i was on a swim team and swimming 4 to 5 miles a day. I was always eating too much even though I wasn't allowed to eat more food than my mom ate at each meal. I was never eating healthy enough even though my mom provided all my food. My hair was never done right. I could go on and on.

My dad was always a good dad when he parented but he was quiet a lot and traveled a lot for work. I think he felt like he was a lesser parent and had less of a say in how we were raised because he was out of town quite a bit. So he was a good dad but a bit absent. 

I moved out of my parents house and made sure to call everyday. I got tired of doing everything wrong in my mom's eyes. I was spending a lot of time helping her around her house, mowing the 4 lawns they have, doing minor repairs in their 4 properties and workingas their handyman. But she kept complaining that i never did anything for her. I couldn't take it anymore so i stopped. I stopped helping and stopped calling.

I answer my mom when she calls but i never call her. Suddenly our communication dropped to once a week. Suddenly all of our conversations are nice. She is constantly giving me gifts to invite me over. She is constantly making food for me and telling me how grateful she is to have such a nice daughter. Suddenly  she is bearable  to talk to. I'm not going to start initiating conversation with her. I think she would revert back to her old behavior. I think she is trying to buy my love. 

My dad seems to think that physically being in the same house as me counts as being there so the day i moved out he set up a schedule for us to meet up on our lunch breaks and we are back to having real conversations.

Sport streaming apps should hide the length of certain sports/events (or maybe all),"I always manage to watch most sports events after the event has been completed and for some sports having the length of the stream can ruin the experience. The most obvious examples are for the second leg of a knock-out football game where a draw will end up in extra time and possibly penalties or an important tennis match where you will immediately understand if they go 4 or 5 sets just by accidentally seeing how long is left in a match.

In my opinion this negatively impacts the way I experience such important events, I am hardly able to watch sport if I know in advance what might happen, in the current situation where most things are watched on streaming after the event is finished I don't think it would be too hard to implement such a feature, while still allowing for a fast forward option without using necessarily a scroll bar on the bottom with the length of the stream.",settlers90,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/12k10zt/sport_streaming_apps_should_hide_the_length_of/,always manage watch sport event event ha completed sport length stream ruin experience obvious example second leg knock football game draw end extra time possibly penalty important tennis match immediately understand go 4 5 set accidentally seeing long left match opinion negatively impact way experience important event hardly able watch sport know advance might happen current situation thing watched streaming event finished think would hard implement feature still allowing fast forward option without using necessarily scroll bar bottom length stream,sport streaming apps hide length certain sport event maybe,settler 90

How do you arrange your music library (on Spotify)?,"Over the years I have been collecting so many music it’s kinda getting to the point of ‘too much to handle’. And I’d love to simplify things right now, but I don’t really know where to start. So I was wondering what other people do, and maybe get some inspiration from that. 

ALL SONGS: I currently create a monthly playlist (feat. the music that came out or that I found in that month, that I like). Eventually, after 12 months I bundle those into 1 playlist of that year (containing around 1750-2250 songs every year). 

BEST SONGS: In addition, I also create a monthly &amp; yearly playlist with the music I love from that year. Such that the bigger playlist is thinned out and more listenable. 

LIBRARY: All of these songs (from the bigger playlist) I then try to filter into their respective genres. Think about: Hip Hop, Rock, Indie, Pop… By the way, this is already a simplified version as I initially categorized them into some of their subgenres too: Rap, RnB, Soul… for example. But this has been taking up way too much time that I don’t have anymore. And I always get too perfectionistic about it such that I will look up which genre a song is to add it to the correct playlist and so on. All while thinking that genres are very subjective lol. 

Feel free to suggest some ways to simplify this whole thing again, or tell us how you collect and organize your music! Also, I don’t use the ‘Liked songs’ function right now. What do you use it for? 

(If you just want a random song recommendation, like in ‘you pick a number and I search for it in my music library’? That’s possible too.)

Funny story about me getting drunk... at age 4.,"So here's the deal. I was taken to a party, I believe for the super bowl in 2013. My mom wanted to find a babysitter, but she couldn't find one, so I just tagged along. My mom went to go talk to her friends, so I was unsupervised. I felt pretty thirsty, so I walked over to the refreshment table. Now here's where  the fun begins. I saw a drink in one of those clear, lever water containers, and was super excited and was like ""Oooooh, lemonade!"" I thought it tasted really good, so I had another. And another. I ended up drinking 3 lemonades. It wasn't filled with lemonade though. It was filled with mimosa. I had 3 MIMOSAS AT AGE 4. I told my mom to ask what the lemonade was, and her face dropped. When I told her I had 3, she was shocked. So I got driven home, put to bed, and woke up with a hangover.

Tired of Reddit trolls,"Buongiorno!

I have had so much experience with Reddit trolls lately who just downvote for fun, comment nonsense, or don't listen to your post on advice or whatnot and just comment whatever they want without actually reading what you've asked/said. Is it the anonymity of Reddit that causes so many people to become so dumb? It's hard for me to figure out why else they'd do this because I feel like Reddit has more trolls than a lot of other social media platforms (totally down for someone to prove me wrong with that though since I only use few).

Suspenders are nice,"Ok hear me out.

I think suspenders have the potential to serve a new role in modern society with the advent of ""more shit to carry in your pockets""

suspenders already provide many positives:

* faith in your pants
* easy adjustment of where pants sit on your waist
* classy look
* no belt compressing your waist / underbelly

 a belt wasn't designed to resist the weight of everything in your pockets like keys, big phones, wallet, and whatever you daily carry

but suspenders can, easily.

"People who enjoy cooking, do restaurants often disappoint you?","So before I knew how to cook, I would eat out a lot and to me it was the pinnacle of dining. But since I started living on my own, and ESPECIALLY since getting married and having a family, I've been cooking my own dishes. It's become a big hobby of mine. I love getting online and finding exciting new recipes. I have a really adventurous palate so I'll often look up cuisines I've never tried before and make dishes that sound good to me. At this point I'm not exactly chef material but I still consider myself a pretty adept cook.

The problem now is that whenever I go to a restaurant, unless it's some new type of food I haven't tried or something I can't make due to the limitations of my kitchen, I'm usually not very impressed. I'll order a dish I make at home and usually comment on how it tastes exactly like how I make it but it's twice the price, or the spices and flavors have been lessened in favor of more sweetness to satisfy the average person, so it just tastes overly sweet and bland, whereas I usually spice things up a lot more and focus on salty and savory flavors.

I messed up with my glasses,"They're just too dang cool.  
I used to primarily wear contacts. They're easier. They're simpler. I can wear sunglasses.  
But then I ran out, my prescription got lost in the move, and I was left with glasses. Ever inexperienced with glasses, I promptly broke them. My options were to either wander around blind or get new ones. I taped them together long enough to get a new prescription, and then ordered new ones off an online company for a whopping $70. (that's how much I typically have to pay for frames, for reference. these came with high quality lenses and everything. for seventy freaking dollars.) Contacts would cost me $300 and my work insurance were undecided on if they'd pay for them. So, glasses it was.  
I freaking fell in love with my frames. For once, I felt absolutely cool in glasses. I was actively tailoring my makeup and outfits around them, and basically got excited to get them on my face everyday.  
I got contacts back a bit ago, but I'm now reluctant to wear them. I like my glasses more. I'd prefer to squint at the sun and get startled at the thing on my face than wear a thing that seamlessly melds onto my eyeball and lets me easily wear sunglasses.

It has an incredible ending that wraps up every little storyline neatly with a bow. It doesn't decline in quality towards the later seasons like a lot of shows do, and it ended perfectly, before it overstays it's welcome.

I’m thinking of quitting my dream job to try to change the world.,"Hey all.

So as the title says I’m weighing the pros and cons of my current job to see if it’s worth staying in. 

The pros are it’s full time and just 3 days a week. The schedule rotates but I always get Sunday off and the others change every 4 week. The pay is $5/hour higher than most jobs with my skill set. Another pro is my team is amazing. I love the people I work with and am treating well. The work is also extremely east. I can leave each day with almost no stress. 

So why would I quit? So the part I am struggling with is I print junk mail for a living. Everything from credit card offers to consolidation loan envelopes. My working week is dedicating to convincing people that they don’t have enough and supporting the credit card industry.

What do I want to do? I want to enact real change in my community. I currently volunteer and engage with city government but feel like maybe taking the pay cut and starting on the ground level in a government or nonprofit would be more fulfilling. All I want to do is help people and my current job doesn’t give me an outlet to do that.

So what would you do in that situation? Keep the job and continue the limited help I can do or make the jump to a thankless low level job that is directly benefiting the community while working on a plan fo level up and enact greater change in society?",impulsiveminimalist,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/12jcrlr/im_thinking_of_quitting_my_dream_job_to_try_to/,hey title say weighing pro con current job see worth staying pro full time 3 day week schedule rotates always get sunday others change every 4 week pay 5 hour higher job skill set another pro team amazing love people work treating well work also extremely east leave day almost stress would quit part struggling print junk mail living everything credit card offer consolidation loan envelope working week dedicating convincing people enough supporting credit card industry want want enact real change community currently volunteer engage city government feel like maybe taking pay cut starting ground level government nonprofit would fulfilling want help people current job give outlet would situation keep job continue limited help make jump thankless low level job directly benefiting community working plan fo level enact greater change society,thinking quitting dream job try change world,impulsive minimalist

These 'artificial intelligence' bots are not AI. They're algorithms.,"As the title states, they're not real AI. Its just a new buzz word that the corporations and tech giants are using to market their crappy products to us.

Why are so many people so positive about the AI?,"I am a big fan of GPT, Midjourney, ElevenLabsm etc. myself, but I think a lot of 'tech people' are overlooking the negatives.

Let's take such a simple position as Junior Coder. With AI sophisicated enough, Senior's won't need Juniors at all, the gap becomes too big and we have to fix the whole system OR Juniors learn to utilize the tools and the gap becomes so small, that the work gets devalued, leading to lower salaries, uneployment and wasted human talent . This wouldn't be such a problem if the shift was gradual, 7-10 years or maybe more. The system would easily adjust, we would create new jobs for people who lost their old. Every company is and will be able to employ AI in the nearest future. Let's take GPT-4, the cost for 1k tokens is something like 3 cents, that's nothing for what it offers. Same for ChatGPT, $20/month isn't a large of a sum in the Western countries. The only thing left, realistically, is physical work, but that excludes a lot of people, for example, some disabled persons. I'm also worried about how the less developed countries will fare, as I've said, $20 isn't that much if you're American, what if you live in Eastern Europe or in Balkans or in Asia though?

It feels like the people working for these big companies want to lead us into some utopia, which, from my point of view, is unattainable for the next 10-100 years, if at all, whilst forgetting that the CEOs they're working for look for profit. And those CEOs are forgetting that broke people can't buy things.

Imagining Life Beyond Artifacts in Museums,"As we walk through museums and admire the artifacts on display, it's easy to forget that these objects were once owned and used by real people. We often fail to imagine what it would have been like to live in the same world as the people who created these artifacts, to talk to them, to share their experiences. Even though we're separated by time and distance, we share commonalities with those who came before us.

It's a curious thing, really, to think about how similar we might be to those who lived hundreds or even thousands of years ago. What would it be like to sit down to a meal with someone from the 5th century or to chat with a Scottish lady from the 17th century? Despite the differences in our circumstances, there is a sense of familiarity that bridges the gap between the past and the present.

The repetitive nature of history also serves as a reminder of our connection to the past. We may be separated by centuries, but the same struggles and triumphs continue to play out in different contexts. Example. whether it's a modern woman living in the 21st century or an aristocratic lady of high English society from the past, there is a shared experience of living in a patriarchal society. Despite the differences in our lives and timelines, the struggle against sexism and the limitations placed on women is something that persists through time.

Perhaps it's through imaginative exercises like these that we can truly connect with the past beyond the artifacts we see in museums. As in the case of Outlander's Claire, who forges bonds with people from a different time through time travel, we too can form a bond with those who came before us by recognizing our commonalities and shared experiences.",Rocket2011,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/12itpza/imagining_life_beyond_artifacts_in_museums/,walk museum admire artifact display easy forget object owned used real people often fail imagine would like live world people created artifact talk share experience even though separated time distance share commonality came u curious thing really think similar might lived hundred even thousand year ago would like sit meal someone 5th century chat scottish lady 17th century despite difference circumstance sense familiarity bridge gap past present repetitive nature history also serf reminder connection past may separated century struggle triumph continue play different context example whether modern woman living 21st century aristocratic lady high english society past shared experience living patriarchal society despite difference life timeline struggle sexism limitation placed woman something persists time perhaps imaginative exercise like truly connect past beyond artifact see museum case outlander claire forge bond people different time time travel form bond came u recognizing commonality shared experience,imagining life beyond artifact museum,rocket 2011
I watched 'Avatar 2' yesterday and here's what I think about it..," I believe The first thing that makes this film unique is the world of Pandora we stepped into. What I really liked about the film is the way James Cameron built the world of Pandora and the reflection of our world, Earth.   


There are a few clear points that I think he wants to say throughout this film.   


***environment and nature:***   
Cameron himself is an environmentalist. The way he portrays the destruction of Nature was heartfelt. He cares about nature and he wants us to care about it too by showing the visuals of the destruction.   


It also may be possible that Cameron wants to give us the message that it's we who should adopt the way of nature and not the other way around. While trying to fix things ultimately we are destroying nature. And it has consequences.   


The way 'kiri' connects with nature and water and all the other things, and she observes and absorbs with them, felt like Cameron wants us to do the same.   


***Family:***   
The film starts with 'Jake's narration about family and love. The transformation of his character as a father is amazing to see. When he says ""A father protects. It’s what gives him meaning"" is something we can relate to,  
 the way 'Jake' leaves the forest to protect his family, somehow depict the thoughts of us humans.   


Also, this film portrays the father-children relationship pretty well. Like 'Lo'ak' trying to be a perfect son and in the end realizing he really can't be a perfect son. And even 'spider' and 'Quaritch' relationship, even after seeing his father ( well technically he is his father) doing all those horribly cruel things, he saved his life in the end.   


***Immigration:***   
When 'Jake' leaves with his family for Awa'atlu, it somehow shows the reality of immigration to another country. we have to learn everything from the beginning to survive there, the same way 'Jake' and his family learn to live in the sea   


***Reflections and detailing:***   
Pandora itself a reflection of Earth. As far as my research is concerned all the things of Pandora is the reflection of Earth. You can see these things mentioned below. 

  
Glowworm Caves, New Zealand.  
Northern Lights.  
Bioluminescent Lagoon, Jamaica.  
Zhangjiajie National Forest Park, China.  
Wisteria Tree at the Ashikaga Flower Park, Ashikaga, Japan.  


'Metkayina' reflects the Bajau Tribe based in Southeast Asia.   


'Tulkun' reflects the whale.  
Even the harpoon used to kill the 'tulkun' is or was exists in real life..  


I found out that Japan is the only country that openly hunts whales these days, and didn't accept the laws of the international whaling commission, and in the film, the ship which was carrying the Harpoon and killed the Tulkun, it's name was written in Japanese and the color was the same of the Japanese flag.   


***Spirituality:***    
'The way of water has no beginning and no end. The sea is around you and in you. The sea is your home before your birth and after your death. The sea gives and the sea takes. Water connects all things.'   
I believe in these lines he is describing our consciousness, I don't want to go into detail, but This is a just perception of mine, I'm leaving it to you.. here's another quote that made my belief more strongly about this ""All energy is borrowed and someday you have to give it back""   


***Cinematography:***   
I don't really have the analysis capabilities that i can judge the cinematography of this film. Russell Carpenter :) :)   


***The world of Pandora:***   
 Cameron put us in the world of Pandora again, he made us feel that Pandora exists, and because of those beautiful visuals, we get connected with the world emotionally as we are connected with this world of ours. It is a simple story yet has so many layers within itself that allow us to connect with the characters and the environment.  and if you think the story is simple and boring so in my opinion In Avatar **""The world itself is the story.""**",Responsible-Rub5582,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/12ipm0u/i_watched_avatar_2_yesterday_and_heres_what_i/,believe first thing make film unique world pandora stepped really liked film way james cameron built world pandora reflection world earth clear point think want say throughout film environment nature cameron environmentalist way portrays destruction nature wa heartfelt care nature want u care showing visuals destruction also may possible cameron want give u message adopt way nature way around trying fix thing ultimately destroying nature ha consequence way kiri connects nature water thing observes absorbs felt like cameron want u family film start jake narration family love transformation character father amazing see say father protects give meaning something relate way jake leaf forest protect family somehow depict thought u human also film portrays father child relationship pretty well like lo ak trying perfect son end realizing really perfect son even spider quaritch relationship even seeing father well technically father horribly cruel thing saved life end immigration jake leaf family awa atlu somehow show reality immigration another country learn everything beginning survive way jake family learn live sea reflection detailing pandora reflection earth far research concerned thing pandora reflection earth see thing mentioned glowworm cave new zealand northern light bioluminescent lagoon jamaica zhangjiajie national forest park china wisteria tree ashikaga flower park ashikaga japan metkayina reflects bajau tribe based southeast asia tulkun reflects whale even harpoon used kill tulkun wa exists real life found japan country openly hunt whale day accept law international whaling commission film ship wa carrying harpoon killed tulkun name wa written japanese color wa japanese flag spirituality way water ha beginning end sea around sea home birth death sea give sea take water connects thing believe line describing consciousness want go detail perception mine leaving another quote made belief strongly energy borrowed someday give back cinematography really analysis capability judge cinematography film russell carpenter world pandora cameron put u world pandora made u feel pandora exists beautiful visuals get connected world emotionally connected world simple story yet ha many layer within allow u connect character environment think story simple boring opinion avatar world story,watched avatar 2 yesterday think,responsible rub 5582

Should I take this job?,"Hi Reddit—

I’m looking for a bit of advice. I just received an offer for a job working on an agent’s desk at an artists agency. The pay is fine, although I would have to work overtime each week in order to make sure I’m earning a livable wage for my city.

I left another corporate job in January after two years of working there — it was also in arts administration, though it was working in marketing for a publisher, so I imagine this potential role will be really different day-to-day. Possibly more stressful? Not sure.

The main rub is that I left the other job earlier this year to pursue the arts myself. At the end of the day, I’d like to be represented BY an agency, rather than work for one. But I have more years of work to put in, I think, before I get to the point of having representation. The desk I would be working on is in the area I’m most interested in working in in the future.

Right now, I work three part time jobs to make ends meet. It’s attractive to me to be able to collapse that down to only worrying about one job, although it will be a much more intense single job than any of the part time jobs I work. One of the people I work for now has a book coming out soon and might need support through that launch, so I’m thinking that if I do take the agency job, I could negotiate the start date to be after his book launches.

What do you guys think? Should I take the job? Or what should I be asking myself to know if I should take it?

"How old were you when you realized what you want to do with your life, career wise?","In a few weeks I'll be 23, and I have no idea what I want to do  in life. Currently I make enough money to comfortably pay my bills and save some money, but that's mainly because my rent is so cheap, and I can't count on it staying that way forever. But I just absolutely don't know what I want to do in life. I'm interested in coding, I've been trying to learn it in my spare time and I don't hate it but I also don't love it, I'm interested in the medical field but again I don't have an actual passion for it, I just feel lost. 

I've tried many things, I did hardwood flooring for 3 years, and while I did like it, the wear and tear on my body wasn't worth it for the abysmal pay, after that I was a correctional officer for awhile and that killed my interest in law enforcement, the 17 hour days, constantly putting up with bullshit, and I did not enjoy when I had to yell at people till I'd lose my voice.

I just don't know what to do. I'm going to keep trying to learn coding, but it's hard to stay excited about it when it's not something I have a passion for.

Ideally I'd like to do one of the obvious choices like musician or comedian since everyone I know tells me I should do standup, but I know those are longshots and to focus on something more realistic.

"Economy class flights need regulations to establish X number of seats per square foot, and the current number should be lowered.","I think its a violation of human rights having to sit in certain airline's economy seats for over two hours. Some airlines (I think CanadaAir) have fine economy seating, but recently I was on a Frontier flight where I literally could not move without touching the person next to me. Couldn't even take my personal item up from under the seat in front of me because of how close the seats are together. I'm not necessarily big or tall either. I have very broad shoulders that I have to tuck together like I have CCD. 

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore, you cannot sleep without laying your head onto the seat in front of you, that is seemingly made out of barbed wire, unless you brought a pillow with you that you will now have to haul around until you get back home/to your destination. Now luckily you have headphones or earbuds, because someone WILL bring their 6 month old child and they WILL scream the entire flight. This is the reward you get after sitting in checked baggage lines and TSA lines, and depending on your airport, can easily combine into a 90 minute ordeal. And don't even get me started on TSA.

&amp;#x200B;

I think corporate greed is growing out of control. The number of seats per plane increases while the size of the plane itself stays the same. All to encourage you to drop an extra $200-400 bucks to upgrade to business for slightly better seats.",JanniesStopBanningMe,8,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/12ig9dd/economy_class_flights_need_regulations_to/,think violation human right sit certain airline economy seat two hour airline think canadaair fine economy seating recently wa frontier flight literally could move without touching person next even take personal item seat front close seat together necessarily big tall either broad shoulder tuck together like ccd amp x200b furthermore cannot sleep without laying head onto seat front seemingly made barbed wire unless brought pillow haul around get back home destination luckily headphone earbuds someone bring 6 month old child scream entire flight reward get sitting checked baggage line tsa line depending airport easily combine 90 minute ordeal even get started tsa amp x200b think corporate greed growing control number seat per plane increase size plane stay encourage drop extra 200 400 buck upgrade business slightly better seat,economy class flight need regulation establish x number seat per square foot current number lowered,j annie stop banning
Highschool senior and struggling,"Late last year I moved to a new area, a new school. With that, anxieties started kicking in and I hardly spoke to anyone. I made no new friends.

How did you know were truly in love with someone?,"I am sitting at my kitchen table while my husband and baby sleep, scrolling Reddit and I stumble on a thread that led to a really deep thought stream about my relationship. 

We’ve been through the ringer and have persevered through it all as a total team. I’ve never questioned my love for him, but I could never pinpoint how it started.

My family completely ignored his boundaries and it led to a pretty horrible argument. We agreed it wasn’t fair to continue a relationship knowing he’d have to deal with that for the rest of his life. We weren’t married yet, it was early on. In previous relationships, I would have groveled and begged to work this out, figure out a way to fix it. But I assured him I agreed, I would never subject him to that treatment for the rest of his life. It was heartbreaking. We parted ways amicably and agreed to wait at least a year before reaching out to each other. 

Three weeks later I found out I was pregnant. Everything changed. We did fix it. We got back together without a conversation and worked on building back communication with my family. 

I sit here now, so blessed and grateful, and curious to hear other stories. Even if they didn’t end happily. I just want to acknowledge that all love is special. And had I not gotten pregnant, who knows where I’d be right now.

Deleted my dating apps!,"I (23f) have deleted my dating apps, I have done this multiple times and ended up re downloading them like 3 weeks later, but hoping this time will be different (have even made an online journal on insta following every day of being single, to keep myself accountable since I have the willpower of a plank of wood lol) 

I’ve been feeling very jaded about modern dating, I hate being so superficial and rejecting people straight out for their looks. I hate how dating is now like a game of who can show they care less about the other person, and I hate being treated like I’m a disposable item.

I also just feel like I’ve got a lot of growing and working on myself to do and that the guy who is someone I will end up with shouldn’t be with someone who can’t let herself be loved, or is just generally feeling so so lost and confused. I’m 23 and I really shouldn’t be feeling like I’m gonna be alone forever haha.

Any ideas on how my nephew can earn money from overseas?,"Hope everyones havin a good Tuesday! I have an 11yo nephew who is saving for a new PC.

Kind of second guessing my major,"So, I’ve always loved chemistry. Out of all of the fields of science and math, it’s easily the one I felt most compelled to.

But, in my senior year of high school I was worried that there aren’t any job prospects or money in chemistry, so I ended up going to college for engineering. I later switched to computer science in university.

I’m graduating soon and I kind of regret that now. Like computer science is fine and all, but I’m realizing I’m still way more interested in chemistry. I’m gonna stick with computer science, but I’ll always have that “what if” I guess.

A family I don't know invited me to celebrate Easter with them because I have no one to celebrate with.,"I moved 11 hours from my family in January. I have no family anywhere near me. A woman I have had a couple conversations with before invited me to celebrate Easter with them at her house and said she would have family there. Easter is an important celebration for me, and I told her I would come. 

A family of about 30 people were at the house, and all different generations. They are a Hispanic family and I am not Hispanic. It was an amazing experience. I got to eat very good Mexican food that they prepared and they taught me some Spanish words. There were Easter eggs filled with paper confetti, so I cam home covered in confetti. I watched home videos on VCR with them, and one family member played his guitar and sang beautifully. A little girl, about 8 years old, asked me if I'm her aunt's cousin (her aunt is the woman who invited me). I told her no, I'm not related to her. My family just lives far away so her aunt invited me to come celebrate with her family so I wouldn't be alone. The girl hugged me and told me I can come to every Easter with her. I almost cried. 

I felt so welcome and loved.

"Music is almost like a drug, it has a GIGANTIC effect on my cognition.","It's crazy how much music can affect your thinking and by extension your entire life.

In college I had sort of an inkling of this. I had a specially curated ""Lift"" playlist for working out, and I specifically picked angry and motivating songs that would help me power through the workout. I was consciously picking songs that would alter my mood in such a way that would be more effective at working out, and I always swore to people that the right song would make you 25% stronger when lifting weights.

Recently I had the idea to make a ""Neutral"" playlist of music. By Neutral I mean only songs with unemotional, basic, non-diatonic songs, songs that specifically are chosen to NOT elicit emotions in me. If I find myself feeling any negative emotions while listening to a song, it's out. WOW. I had no idea that taking such a simple step of making a playlist would change my life so much. By just having a constant mix of ""neutral"" music on in the background, I have found myself with more energy, a more positive mood, less negative thoughts, and more motivation to work on projects. For YEARS I have struggled with motivation and positive thinking. Who would have thought that simply changing the noises in my life could have such a huge effect?

Now granted, time will tell whether my ""Neutral"" playlist keeps working. But I can tell you that my ""Lift"" playlist never lost its potency, so I'm hopeful.

Does anyone else have any experiences with this phenomenon, or advice on other sorts of ""specialty playlists"" one could develop?",deathloopTGthrowway,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/12i3ok6/music_is_almost_like_a_drug_it_has_a_gigantic/,crazy much music affect thinking extension entire life college sort inkling specially curated lift playlist working specifically picked angry motivating song would help power workout wa consciously picking song would alter mood way would effective working always swore people right song would make 25 stronger lifting weight recently idea make neutral playlist music neutral mean song unemotional basic non diatonic song song specifically chosen elicit emotion find feeling negative emotion listening song wow idea taking simple step making playlist would change life much constant mix neutral music background found energy positive mood le negative thought motivation work project year struggled motivation positive thinking would thought simply changing noise life could huge effect granted time tell whether neutral playlist keep working tell lift playlist never lost potency hopeful doe anyone else experience phenomenon advice sort specialty playlist one could develop,music almost like drug ha gigantic effect cognition,death loop tg throw way

Realizing it's time to return home...,"Hello! I'm just some average nobody, with a decent-paying corporate job, a STEM degree, in a major metro area. I do my job well, I get along with my coworkers, I get good performance reviews, and I occasionally get to hang out with some friends. I go to church on Sundays, and have no debt. Sounds great, right?

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, I miss my family. I moved a \~400 miles away from a small town in the country (but not horribly small, \~60k people), and now I only get to see them about a half-dozen times a year. There's a lot of people back home I miss, and I just feel a bit... lost... in the ""big city"". My job is pretty stressful, and I think it's made me realize that after waking up day after day already stressed out, with no real support system here, what really matters in life - family. I'm also not a fan of the concrete jungle, I like the outdoors, riding ATVs, and generally not drowning in traffic everywhere I go. I really don't like living in a $1500, one-bedroom apartment. What I really want is a 2000sqft house, on an acre of land, with a workshop in the back. That's just not possible here, both by average tiny lot size and the insane cost of housing. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been looking at jobs back home, which is a bit harder than finding a job around here. My hometown doesn't have a large presence in my career field, but they do exist, and luckily I've been referred into a promising position. I've been told that they plan to interview me soon, after they fill another high-priority position first. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think it goes against the norm these days to want to move closer to family rather than away, especially when that involves putting my career second. Realistically, I want to move somewhere with a lower cost of living, and generally just not be part of the rat race like I am now.

Does anyone else sometimes have weird spatial experiences before falling asleep?,"I guess „spatial experiences“ sounds odd but I don’t know how to describe it. 

Sometimes when I close my eyes and lay in bed before falling asleep, I get this feeling that my surroundings are getting smaller and smaller while also spinning.

Say I’m laying there, eyes closed, my face is in the direction of my nightstand and I would see that nightstand if I opened my eyes. Suddenly this feeling starts that the nightstands moves further and further away from me (or I further away from it). Everything gets smaller and smaller as it moves away, sometimes it feels like I’m spinning too. 

As soon as I open my eyes it stops. I can snap out of it any time. 

It sounds kinda unpleasant but it really isn’t. It’s not particularly pleasant or anything, it’s just an odd feeling. I remember it from being a kid, where I experienced this every single time I had a fewer. It’s gotten more rare now (I’m in my mid 20s) but sometimes it still happens.

Has anyone experienced anything similar?

I saved a puppy :),"I was recently taking a long walk maybe 20 ish minutes from my house and I was standing at a cross walk waiting for it to allow me to go but then I heard like a dog cry and I was confused, there was one of those ditches next to that road for like if there was a flood or somthing, and it has recently rained A LOT so I'm looking at it and I see like one of those turkey hill baggys floating in the water barley staying a surface but I noticed it was kinda inflated like it had a object in it.

So obviously I picked it up and brought it onto the side walk and opened it and it had a little doggo in it that looked like it was 2 months old like the size of a smaller chihuahua that looked like it was hanging on by a thread, so I called my mom and explained everything to her.

She came and picked me up and we took it to the vet to see if they could do anything. They couldn't really do much expect clean it's fur and stuff and check for ticks.


Afterwards we took it to our local pound.

I think my coworker hates me for some reason,I (22m) am pretty sure my coworker doesn’t like me but I don’t know why. Let’s call her “Stacy”. Stacy is around my age (no less than 20) and she’s an intern where I work. I just started this full time job a couple weeks ago and everyone in my department works in close quarters. Everyday she comes in and says a general “good morning” to everyone in the room simultaneously and kind of scans the room to acknowledge that she hears everyone say it back. She has a smile/grin when she looks at everybody but when she looks at me it’s cold. Like she genuinely looks disturbed by my mere presence and i just don’t know why. We’ve never had a conversation with each other so I’m not sure what I could’ve done to offend her. The work environment isn’t hostile or anything but I’ve noticed the cold stare on several occasions. I just wanted to share.

What the Rubik's Cube did for me,"When I was deployed to the Middle East in 2018, I knew I had a long plane ride before I ever got in country.

On a whim, I purchased a Rubik's Cube. I figured it couldn't possibly be that hard, and I had a 16 hour flight to figure it out. I vastly overestimated my abilities. While I could solve the white face, but I couldn't figure out how to insert the edge pieces over the corners. 

While waiting in a terminal after the first leg, my friend asked to see the Rubik's Cube so he could show me how to solve it. He did so, and he asked me if I ""caught all that."" Of course, I hadn't, but it motivated me even more so to pursue solving it. 

I googled basic algorithms, and screen-shotted them. I spent the remaining flight time establishing an understanding of solving the ""first two layers."" But I struggled with the yellow face.

Before long, I found myself in Kuwait, waiting for yet another flight. Another friend approached me, and reinforced the method I had been practicing for the better part of a day. But he also taught me how to solve the last pieces of the cube - the remaining corners that you seemingly have to destroy all your progress to solve. Maybe there's a life lesson in there?

Then I boarded my flight to Afghanistan. 

People often say that war isn't like the movies, but I do tend to disagree - at least regarding contemporary films like The Outpost, Fury and We Were Soldiers. It's a lot of boredom followed by very intense periods of fear and adrenaline. The Rubik's Cube prevented boredom, but it was also an outlet when you needed to escape the chaos.

That Rubik's Cube, was it's own little world. It was order. It was something that could be controlled. Before long, my fellow troops were learning to solve it. Some to stave off boredom, others wanted to learn because they saw me doing it. I think we all liked that it let us take back a little control in our lives.

We began to race each other as best we could. We'd time one another, and I think the fastest anyone ever got on that thing was about 1:10. We thought we were Gods. 

We even began to introduce higher order puzzles like the 5x5 and megaminx. New challenges to overcome; new opportunities to restore order.

Through all the chaos, we always came back to these cubes. They provided a reprieve from the day-to-day; a minute of distraction from an environment we were unwelcome in.

Even now, struggling with my PTSD, anxiety and stress, I come back to the Rubik's Cube. 

So what has the Rubik's Cube done for me? It's given me thousands of opportunities to restore order in my head, if only for a moment. It's provided me thousands of brief respites from how harsh life can be.

Even though I can solve it in twenty seconds now, it still has a vast well of techniques, tricks and algorithms to learn. More mysteries to uncover.

Moreover, it helps me connect with people; I've lost count of the number of people I have taught to solve it. It helps me see the tangible impact we all have on those around us.

Its something to focus on that isn't life, but in a way, I think it helped save mine.",bangbangboomboom19,134,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/12gka0v/what_the_rubiks_cube_did_for_me/,wa deployed middle east 2018 knew long plane ride ever got country whim purchased rubik cube figured possibly hard 16 hour flight figure vastly overestimated ability could solve white face figure insert edge piece corner waiting terminal first leg friend asked see rubik cube could show solve asked caught course motivated even pursue solving googled basic algorithm screen shotted spent remaining flight time establishing understanding solving first two layer struggled yellow face long found kuwait waiting yet another flight another friend approached reinforced method practicing better part day also taught solve last piece cube remaining corner seemingly destroy progress solve maybe life lesson boarded flight afghanistan people often say war like movie tend disagree least regarding contemporary film like outpost fury soldier lot boredom followed intense period fear adrenaline rubik cube prevented boredom wa also outlet needed escape chaos rubik cube wa little world wa order wa something could controlled long fellow troop learning solve stave boredom others wanted learn saw think liked let u take back little control life began race best could time one another think fastest anyone ever got thing wa 1 10 thought god even began introduce higher order puzzle like 5x5 megaminx new challenge overcome new opportunity restore order chaos always came back cube provided reprieve day day minute distraction environment unwelcome even struggling ptsd anxiety stress come back rubik cube ha rubik cube done given thousand opportunity restore order head moment provided thousand brief respite harsh life even though solve twenty second still ha vast well technique trick algorithm learn mystery uncover moreover help connect people lost count number people taught solve help see tangible impact around u something focus life way think helped save mine,rubik cube,bang bang boom boom 19
"I just discovered car sharing in my city, and it’s been the answer i’ve been trying to find all these years","For context, I got my driver’s license 10 years ago and I’ve never been touching a steering wheel for 10 years straight, because I always used my scooter to go to work. Fees for cars is so daunting for me it’s really hard to think expensive fees to own a car.

So fast forward today, my sis just passed her quiz test for driver’s license and she just received her permit to practice, and Ive been stressed on getting a car because Im afraid I am losing my knowledge to drive. I always thought that if ever I buy a car, i would only use it 2 times a year: going to comic con, and maybe beach, but Im not even a beach guy.

So one day I researched and Ive stumbled on this car sharing in my city: which I always ignored because I always supposed the fees were high. Little to know fees are low. € 0,29 per minute. So it was my ticket into relearning how to drive. One night I brought my sis to drive the car for the first time again. It was good, I still can drive but… I had the hand brake up all the time. 

Second time was better, and I also let my sis drive to learn how to use clutch. Digging into the rabbit hole, on the site it says “you can drive  even outside the area, for as long as you like, dont go out of the country, just bring back the car in the city area”. So i said “so I can go to comic con with a car? I ignored this gem all of these years??! All those years I spent waiting in line in train for comic con to go back home?

I might not be good at my music by concert time,"My school has our spring concert on May 17th. In jazz band, I play the piano. I’ve only been playing the piano for a few years. On top of that, I only joined band last year. I got a late start to music compared to my peers. And since we’re in high school, the music I’m playing is relatively complex. It’s not technically challenging, but given it’s jazz, there’s a lot of overwhelming chords and confusing syncopation. And lastly, my left hand, the bass, often has a much different part than my right hand. That has never been my strong suit, even in simple pieces. 

I wouldn’t consider myself a bad pianist by any means, but when I learn songs, I like to take my time breaking them down. This has left my sight reading skills subpar, and I’m much behind everyone else. Therefore, I’m scared I’ll fall not have my pieces learnt by the looming date of the concert.

I had a similar fiasco at our Christmas concert. Knowing I wasn’t yet ready, I “crammed” learning my pieces in the last week. And free time I had was spent at the piano. I had managed to somewhat scrape the songs into songs that carried a steady groove. However, once the concert actually came, I panicked and only played one hand.

A rumble of thoughts,"What if i just do it?

What if i just put my head down, align my focus and just do it? 

This life is my playground and i choose how my life plays out, i choose my story. 

Im still young, i have plenty of time to become something.

We all have the ability to be anything, to do anything, we just have to do it.


One, we all get one life, think about it, ONE. And most of us aren’t even happy? 


Whats the purpose of living a miserable life doing the things you hate.


We’re all clouded from the masses, where we try to fit in, make sure to say the right thing. Trying our best not to be judged.


Who gives a fuck?


It’s literally a pointless psychological battle we inflict on ourselves.


Pain is inevitable, the pain and discipline of doing great things. And the pain and regret from not doing things.


Worry consumes time. Just think about the regret if you don’t do the thing NOW.



Why are you letting that thing bother you so much? Just stop thinking about it.




You regretting that one thing, should be a tell tale to not take time for granted.



Why do you seek approval of others?




We spend the majority of time in our heads, in a second world, a world of regret and worry.




We chase things that ultimately won’t matter when we pass. That should tell you something. The fact that nothing gets carried over in the transition to the afterlife. Why chase?



You’re controlled by lust.



Are you really dumb? Or see you letting others frame the way you think about yourself.


We love ourselves more than anybody else yet we care more about what other people think.



Most of us die not living a life fullfilled, missed so much on opportunity and chance. All because we were scared.



We live a life immersed in screens, we are so diverted from reality. 


We are staring at the world through a screen, when all we have to do is look up.



You wasted so much time being heartbroken, literally another person affected your life. It’s silly.



Nothing external can hurt you. Anything that hurts is your fault. Because internally you allowed yourself to perceive something as hurtful. Just pay no mind.



Did you get the latest clothing? Did you get the latest phone? Are you up to date on slang, are you keeping up with trends? Are you doing good in this social hierarchy?

All Nonsense 




Nobody knows the meaning of life, yet we yell, condemn, and judge? Who are we to pose that authority? Everyone is a mirrored you. Maybe a different name, maybe a different color, maybe a different gender? But they eat, drink, breathe like you?

Who the fuck are you? You’re not better than anyone, nor is anyone any better than you.

I'm getting too old for this.,"It's like a ritual.

Get the essentials bag ready, put on your favorite band tee that matches the genre if you don't already have merch from them. Pack light and don't forget the hydration.

I've been to several dozens of festivals/concerts before, everything ranging from rap to edm to indie and back round again. The volume of the music, the energy of the crowd, the camaraderie of being with your brothers and sisters in the thick of musical bliss.

I've seen drama unfold, people get kicked out, almost got kicked out myself, and the moshing. The wonderful moshing. I had a ticket to go see a set, no big names in particular, just an event with some guys playing some classic early to late 00s angsty music, the kind that you used to listen to in the car and got the inspiration to dye your hair like Gerard Way because you thought you could pull it off.

They started playing some metal in the mix. Couldn't tell you the band, may have been As I Lay Dying. I felt the irresistible urge to jump head long into a mosh pit. Nothing new to me, I am a little bit on the skinnier side so I do take it easy until I get a feel for it, can't really throw my weight around. 

Now I am by no means young, but I haven't hit the threshold for being *""old""* yet. The shoving began and I was getting tossed around like I was in some human shaped blender. Event ends and I manage to make it home.

The day after, the adrenaline of the night before had worn off, and it felt like my entire body felt like it was being torn apart by razor wire. Someone had stepped on my foot with combat boots on and I am now very obviously walking with a limp. My face has a few minor cuts and a portion of my leg has a serious looking bruise.

I am aware and embarrassed to know that I make everything about me,"I have a tendency to subtly and almost unconsciously steer every conversation towards myself or make it about me. This behavior is not noticeable to others because I am able to conceal it effectively. However, I am conscious of it and aware when I am doing it. For example, when a group of people discusses a topic, the content shared is primarily objective. The participants do not draw attention to their opinions or past experiences unless it contributes to the conversation.  I struggle to read the room or gauge others' reactions before I speak. During a conversation, I tend to inject information about myself or my experiences that doesn't necessarily contribute to the topic or interest others. I later realize that I've drawn attention to myself for no good reason. Even though others may not notice, it creates a sense of disconnection on my part because my focus is on seeking the group's attention rather than engaging with the topic at hand. I don't intend to do this, and it's embarrassing when I realize it later. This has happened so frequently that I've become reluctant to talk to people and have reduced my socialization to only what is necessary at work.",Own_Egg7122,12,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/12hcmm3/i_am_aware_and_embarrassed_to_know_that_i_make/,tendency subtly almost unconsciously steer every conversation towards make behavior noticeable others able conceal effectively however conscious aware example group people discus topic content shared primarily objective participant draw attention opinion past experience unless contributes conversation struggle read room gauge others reaction speak conversation tend inject information experience necessarily contribute topic interest others later realize drawn attention good reason even though others may notice creates sense disconnection part focus seeking group attention rather engaging topic hand intend embarrassing realize later ha happened frequently become reluctant talk people reduced socialization necessary work,aware embarrassed know make everything,egg 7122
Driving is hard.,"So I’ve only been driving for about 3 months and I thought I was gonna get the hang of it really fast.

So every time I drive at the speed limit someone honks at me and starts getting really close. And even when I’m not at local roads like I could be stopping bc there’s a red light and people will still get really close and that makes me nervous.

Life’s spark has been waning for me,"Over the course of the past few months, I’ve been doing a bunch of things to improve my life. In January I uninstalled Tik Tok and cut back tremendously on my use of social media. Around February, I started going on a walk every evening to watch the sunset. Those two things are just small, but they’ve made my life a lot better. Getting off my phone and going outside gave me a huge mood boost. I started to fall back in love with life.

Recently, that spark has been waning. That little thing that gave me joy no longer has the same effect. Don’t get me wrong, I’m still better off than I was before, but I wish I could be as happy as I once was. Maybe I’m growing bored of the same routine? Maybe I’ve seen too many sunsets and most of them don’t compare to the prettiest ones? Maybe this dullness is just temporary and I should see my changes through? Who knows?

Opinions on two job offers?,"Hey all, my spouse and I are at a standstill. Could use some outside opinions. My spouse has two job offers currently, one at Kaiser for a part-time call center, the other a full time position for an elderly care facility in management. 

The Kaiser pros are the wonderful health care benefits, that would cover my spouse, child, and myself. It’s also a large corporation and union, so there is opportunity for growth within. The negatives are that the position is part time, with weekly changing schedules, and it pays a few dollars less than the other

The elder facility pros are it pays more, and is steady work that guarantees our bills are covered. The negatives are that there is no room for promotion or advancement, so there is no long term growth potential, and the health care is just ok, and doesn’t cover the spouse, just the child. 

We can make both work, with hustling on Instacart/Uber on the side. With Kaiser that will be a must. With the other it is an option. 

Any ideas? Anyone know anything about advancing at Kaiser?

I hate when people can’t make decisions and asking me what I think about every little thing,"For as long as I can remember my mom has always had a really hard time making decisions. I don’t mean big ones, but things like produce at the store. She’ll spend 5 minutes examining a bag of avocados, ask me which one is better to which I randomly choose one because I CANNOT tell the difference, and then she tells me that actually she thinks the other one is better. 

She also likes shopping which I hate and constantly brings home new pieces of clothing then tries them on and asks me which one looks better (she often buys multiple copies of the same item just in case something fits better). The thing is it all looks the same to me? She can spend an hour changing and asking me what looks better and if I can tell which one she’s wearing now. No mom, I can’t. 

She’s incapable of making a decision without someone’s validation or input and I feel like such a bad person for saying this but I genuinely can’t stand people who do this.

"F1 Fans of Reddit, what do you think of the reddit F1 scene?","I am currently taking a performance studies course and am to do some field research as a part of it. Any of your answers to the questions below may be quoted indirectly. My topic is on the F1 Reddit community and how the subreddit r/formula1 may shape the way that fans interact with both in person races and streamed events. Below are some of the questions I am looking for answers on, if anyone can contribute it'd be appreciated!

	1	Why do F1 fans tend to flock to Reddit opposed to other platforms?
	2	What kind of information is shown in the televised event (pre-show, qualifying, race, interviews) and what can you learn about the drivers from only this perspective? Do you have more power as a spectator at a race live? Less constrained by producers’ choices and sometimes untrue narratives e.g., Carlos Sainz getting no camera time
	3	What knowledge do you gain from the subreddits? How does this information affect the way you watch F1 races, if at all?
	4	What are the unnamed rules of the subreddits, what is not allowed to be talked about? (other than the obvious, racism, unkind behaviour)
	5	When do you check the subreddits, what type of mood are you in when you check them, do you check them more often pre, post, or during a race?
	6	What are the conflicts other than driver vs. driver or team vs. team? What divides F1 fans on reddit?
	7	How do flairs affect the subreddits, what would happen if they were taken away?
	8	How can you tell if someone is a “real” fan on Reddit, what singles you out, and how do you think remaining anonymous affects everything and who has the most credibility?
	9	Is the conversation to be had on the subreddits deep and meaningful?
	10	Ok last one, How does Reddit shape fan relationships and interactions at live events? Is there a certain slang you've adopted, things you know are of sore topic to speak about, a controversy to discuss that weekend, where the best grandstands are at to sit, what's worth your money, who to watch that weekend, etc.?",aqua_sou1,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/12hydlj/f1_fans_of_reddit_what_do_you_think_of_the_reddit/,currently taking performance study course field research part answer question may quoted indirectly topic f1 reddit community subreddit r formula1 may shape way fan interact person race streamed event question looking answer anyone contribute appreciated 1 f1 fan tend flock reddit opposed platform 2 kind information shown televised event pre show qualifying race interview learn driver perspective power spectator race live le constrained producer choice sometimes untrue narrative e g carlos sainz getting camera time 3 knowledge gain subreddits doe information affect way watch f1 race 4 unnamed rule subreddits allowed talked obvious racism unkind behaviour 5 check subreddits type mood check check often pre post race 6 conflict driver v driver team v team divide f1 fan reddit 7 flair affect subreddits would happen taken away 8 tell someone real fan reddit single think remaining anonymous affect everything ha credibility 9 conversation subreddits deep meaningful 10 ok last one doe reddit shape fan relationship interaction live event certain slang adopted thing know sore topic speak controversy discus weekend best grandstand sit worth money watch weekend etc,f1 fan reddit think reddit f1 scene,aqua u 1

(I think) someone tried to fight me over my pants showing the top of my butt crack.,"The  reason that I say I think is because it's not like this was  preplanned... and I can't read minds. So maybe he didn't know his  actions and behvours can result in a fight? While I doubt it... it's  possible.

So, my wife and I were  at the store the other day when I hear ""Pull your damn pants up. Pull  your FUCKING PANTS UP!"" from off to my left pretty far behind me.At  first, I didn't react, not thinking it was directed at me, but pretty  quickly I reached back and, yep, the very top of my butt crack was  showing.

I turn around intending  to say sorry, as I was embarrassed, but by the time I'm fully turned  around, this man is actually waking towards Cynthia and I. And he's  still repeating, ""Pull your fucking pants up!"" 

A good defensive position to take, and the one that I took,is to simply raise your hands: Making  sure your fingers are spread out (in case you need to grab), raise your  hands to right about shoulder height. You're trying to put your hands  at the same height as your sholder blades behind them.  
Secondly, your hands should be a little bit out from your body. I suggest four to six inches.  
The  person in question that caused you to take this stance should not be  allowed to get close enough to actually touch your hand.

So  I'm standing there with my hands up and out and I'm trying to tell this  dude ""Hey, no problem, I'm sorry for the mistake"" but he's not hearing  me.He gets about two and a half feet away and my wife steps out in front of him with her arms wide out. She tells him ""back off. He's tired, he didn't think about it, it's fixed.""I've  already talked to her about the fact that while I appreciate her doing  that, I would prefer her not to put herself in danger for me. She's very  brave, though.After she repeats that a couple of times, the dude smiles and turns around..

It was just such a strange encounter, you know?

Why does he have these strange habits? Did you meet anybody who did stuff like this?,"My boyfriend has 3 pairs of the same pants that he wears every day. They're just plain black pants. He also has 3 pairs of the exact same shoes. When I asked him about them, he said ""I just like them, so I bought pairs so I always have some even if they're in the wash basket"". Ok, fine.

But then he does things like put ice cubes in his food. He says ""When the food is too hot to eat I put them in to cool it down, just like drinks"". I've seen him put them in mashed potato, soup, coffee, and I've seen him put ice cubes in a small plastic bag and place it on top of pizza. Nobody else does that, right?

Speaking of food, he eats a shitload of lettuce. He will just pick a leaf off and crunch on it, 3-5 times a day.

When he is sick, he sleeps in the bathtub. I guess this is a comfort thing which I can understand, but it's still a bit odd.

He owns a slingshot and **keeps it in his pocket**, and sets up targets around his house. When he's walking about, he pulls out his slingshot randomly and spins and fires, hitting the target. He has very good accuracy, but why in the house? The little metal balls that he fires end up on the floor and hurt like a bitch if you stand on them, they're everywhere.

His mail comes through in many different names, he says it's for privacy. ""When I sign up to places I give a fake name so if I get junk mail, I know who did it"". But he doesn't write any of the names down, so he can't remember which names relate to which companies, completely defeating the purpose! And when spam callers ring, he will derail the conversation and try to talk to them about their life.

Every time there's a thunderstorm, he runs outside into the rain to spectate, regardless of what he is wearing.

I feel like these would be red flags, but the guy is charming and I love his quirks.

Apparently I’m a medical freak (marvel?),"Had some really bad injuries a decade ago that took many surgeries to fix.

I recently had a real bad flair up in pain. When I went to doc, the nurse asked me questions about my injury and she made so many comment like “omg, that’s crazy” and “I’ve never heard of that even happening” also “this is beyond what I can imagine.”

The doctor , who was not my surgeon but just a pcp, said she needed hours to study my chart before seeing me and she had to contact colleagues and experts to help understand. When we talked she was like “I can’t even imagine this” and “oh wow, that’s even worse than I thought, your chart can’t even explain how bad it is”

When I went to get X-rays, the tech was like “I’ve never seen anything like this before” and “I have no idea what I’m even looking at, how is this even possible.”

It was hours of comments like that. I definitely played it off since it’s not the first time I’ve experienced this, but it’s been awhile.  Not sure how I feel about it…",TheObviousDilemma,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/12hjqof/apparently_im_a_medical_freak_marvel/,really bad injury decade ago took many surgery fix recently real bad flair pain went doc nurse asked question injury made many comment like omg crazy never heard even happening also beyond imagine doctor wa surgeon pcp said needed hour study chart seeing contact colleague expert help understand talked wa like even imagine oh wow even worse thought chart even explain bad went get x ray tech wa like never seen anything like idea even looking even possible wa hour comment like definitely played since first time experienced awhile sure feel,apparently medical freak marvel,obvious dilemma
How many years that it took you to move on form gacha games or addiction?,"It took 5 years to do it, which I dropped at before the end of 2022.

Crying feels so good.,"I have been feeling bad for the past few days for several reasons and I feel like I am unheard or unseen by my closest people. Not that I need their comfort, but I am unconsciously shrugging it off, forgetting about the bad things quickly to focus on the good ones and laughing it off for good vibes, good energy, you know... But many happy and exciting things happened this week too! It wasn't all that bad... But still... there are a lot of undealt emotions I didn't know I need to acknowledge and recognize.

What happened was... I was watching a light comedy series that had a pinch of drama and slice of life. The girl protagonist has a strong personality and there was a scene where she was being comforted by her mom through a letter and her partner just sat by her side while she cries it all out. I really felt for her and somehow reflected on her. While watching, I then started crying it out with her while also having flashbacks on what happened to me the past few days. I was crying like a child, having a hard time to breathe! Thinking, that I was able to survive it all by myself and I'm proud of me. But I wanted that comfort as well. I'm craving for that care. I suddenly craved for just somebody to check on me sometimes.

It was a good, comforting cry!

Pretty sure I have just proven that I am certifiably insane.,"I play slo pitch in the summers. I love baseball and I love to play. I play in a league on Wednesday nights, which my husband's company has started sponsoring my team.

I also play on Sunday nights in another league in another town close by. The team I played with for the past two years was made up of mostly middle  aged people (my age give or take a couple of years) and a lot of them have decided not to play again this summer. So our team disbanded. However, the coordinator of the league keeps texting and calling me because he needs more female players in the league and there are teams in need of female players (it's a co-ed league and there are strict rules about batting order with the right number of female players.)

Well, I finally got back to him because I don't like ignoring people, and he offered me a spot on the Friday league was well - FOR FREE. 

Who needs rest? Because now I'll be playing in 3 leagues in 2 cities (okay, towns, really). But who passes up an entire summer season FREE!? All I'll have to pay is $35 for my jersey.

"Going back to school soon, I miss project work, assignments and lectures.","I'm not really mature in my early 20s, I was hopping from job to job and just couldn't settle down and commit to something. And to top it off, my mental state was in a rough shape and I spent some months as a shut in. I enrolled into a local CS program, which I paid for myself, and things were going well initially before I fell into truancy. Retook a module, failed another and barely passed a bunch of others. I then made the dumb decision to withdraw from the program.

Now, it's been almost a year since I was out, I was still working part time jobs while interviewing for software engineering jobs. Things were going great, had a bunch of interviews but things took a turn for the worse with the market and opportunities became scarce and one company which I passed the interview bar froze hiring. I was left with nothing, who wants someone with just an associates.

I have since took a test engineer role, which involves zero coding, and applied to enroll back into to complete the CS program in a part time capacity. Honestly the market is rough, but I'm also asking for it by trying to jump the gun with an incomplete degree. Now I'm just waiting for classes to start next quarter.

If I was matured enough and completed the program in one sitting things might've turned out differently, but that's in the past. My focus now is work full time and take on studies part time, this time round I will attend all lectures dutifully and complete all assignments way before deadline.

It's not either like when you are in the bus and you see the whole world but you can't interact with it because the world is moving and it's just like a loading screen.

The Struggle of Having Many Skills But No Clients,"I have a problem. A big problem. I have a lot of skills, but I'm not making any money. It's not that I don't want to work hard or that I'm not trying to find clients. It's just that it's so damn hard to make a living doing what I love.

Let me tell you a little bit about myself.  I can light up a room with positive energy, make people feel heard, have friendly conversations, help people discover their natural talents/skills.

 I'm also quite talented in a number of skills, I can write, design, create content, carry out research, manage social media pages, I'm basically a one-person army. But despite my many talents, I can't seem to catch a break. I don't like breaking down, but sometimes I get to overwhelmed not to.

I love putting my skills to use. It makes me feel alive and purposeful. But when I'm not making any money, it's hard to stay motivated. It's like I'm constantly banging my head against a brick wall. No matter how hard I try, I just can't seem to break through.

I'm not alone in this struggle, of course. There are many people out there who are just like me, trying to make a living doing what they love.

It's not just about the money. It's about the satisfaction of doing something that I love and being paid for it. It's about having the freedom to choose the projects that I work on and the clients that I work with.

In a way, it's a journey of love, frustration, and hunger. Love for what I do, frustration at the difficulties of finding clients, and hunger for success and recognition.

So I'll keep on hustling, keep on putting myself out there, and keep on doing what I love. Because I know that soon enough, my skills will be recognized and I'll be able to make a living doing what I enjoy doing. Until then, I'll just have to make sure I have enough ramen noodles to sustain me through the tough times.",Cool_Independent_,17,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/12hfyeq/the_struggle_of_having_many_skills_but_no_clients/,problem big problem lot skill making money want work hard trying find client damn hard make living love let tell little bit light room positive energy make people feel heard friendly conversation help people discover natural talent skill also quite talented number skill write design create content carry research manage social medium page basically one person army despite many talent seem catch break like breaking sometimes get overwhelmed love putting skill use make feel alive purposeful making money hard stay motivated like constantly banging head brick wall matter hard try seem break alone struggle course many people like trying make living love money satisfaction something love paid freedom choose project work client work way journey love frustration hunger love frustration difficulty finding client hunger success recognition keep hustling keep putting keep love know soon enough skill recognized able make living enjoy make sure enough ramen noodle sustain tough time,struggle many skill client,cool independent

I met someone from my country online,"A few years ago I was on Omegle, because I was bored. I've really never met anyone from my country or even my general area online, and because of the time of day most of everyone were North American. One person in particular I talked with for quite a bit. Since neither of us look like we're from our country (Both not African) we both assumed there was no way the other could have been. 

I did pick something up from her accent, it sounded familiar. I live in Botswana which is in southern Africa, it's big in size but barely has 2 million people, and a good portion of the population don't have an internet access, so you can understand the impossible odds when I asked her where she's from, to which she nonchalantly said ""Maun"" like I knew, except I absolutely did. I think she said that because she expected me to ask a follow-up question like ""Where's Maun?"".

Instead of getting all excited, I said ""I'm from Ramotswa"" which is an even more rural, small town on the opposite side of the country. When I tell you the smile that appeared on her face lit up my whole room! We've been online friends ever since.

I have decided that I'm going to read my first actual book 😁,"I know how to read and have read some stuff, but have never read an actual complete novel all the way through before. I do read some manga and graphic novels and have listened to a couple audio books but that's pretty much it

I have adhd so I can get pretty bored if im just sitting in one spot for a while, and I also have dyslexia which makes it kinda difficult for me to read these huge pages full of small text in the first place, so I kinda just never read but it's super embarrassing for me to tell people or if someone asks what my favorite book is and I don't have an answer 😭

BUT I found a book in my dads library that I think I'll actually be able to read and ngl im actually really excited 😁😁

It's Journey to the Center of the Earth by Jules Verne. It's actually kind of perfect because it's a pretty short stand alone book (i think) so I don't have to make a huge commitment and im less likely to get bored

Are the younger generations wasting their youth by spending so much time inside and alone?,"I recently saw a video in which the creator was arguing that young adults should not be glorifying “living like a grandma” ie being a homebody, not going out much, spending all their time in their house/room. 

I’m in my mid twenties and I’m very much that person. I go to work and the gym, but other than that, I have no social life. For various reasons I don’t live near any friends and I’m not close with family. Anywhere that I could go, I’d be going alone. 

I try to be content with this but at the same time this video struck a chord with me. I don’t want to look back when I’m 80 and feel that I wasted my younger years sitting alone in my room. 

What do you think? If you’re my age, are you also a homebody? If you’re older, do you look back and regret being one? If you don’t relate to that, do you agree that the younger generations are glorifying what is actually a sad lifestyle?",CriticalRoll2322,206,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/12fycrn/are_the_younger_generations_wasting_their_youth/,recently saw video creator wa arguing young adult glorifying living like grandma ie homebody going much spending time house room mid twenty much person go work gym social life various reason live near friend close family anywhere could go going alone try content time video struck chord want look back 80 feel wasted younger year sitting alone room think age also homebody older look back regret one relate agree younger generation glorifying actually sad lifestyle,younger generation wasting youth spending much time inside alone,critical roll 2322

"Today is the first Easter where there are no kids in our family to have the shebang, and I’m okay with it.","Happy Easter to those who celebrate!

I have a big family and being in a big family means that there is almost always a few kids. And that means every year for every major gift or food based holiday that’s marketed towards kids, we have some kind of setup for the house. 

For example; for Easter we set up an egg hunt that has a bunch of riddles to find the next one and the last one takes you to your basket. 

For Christmas, the Santa gift is set up and ready to be played with immediately along with your stocking next to it to show its yours. 

Well the last kids in the family for now (youngest being 11, so he was probably almost out of the game anyway) are off on a cruise so now in our house it’s my fiancé, me, and my mother. And after the 27 years I’ve been alive (and however longer it was before me) this is the first Easter where it’s just another day, and my mom is kind of sad about it, so I’m gonna make a nice steak dinner and play some games with her.

Exactly a year ago, I was preparing for the same paper I am preparing now. Was not in the best mental state then. Failed that paper twice but things are so different now from what they were 1 year ago, I have so many more achievements in my finances, dreams which I didn't even dare to see are true now feels unreal, I experienced romantic relationships for the first time no matter how short they were, made so many memories with my online friends had fun with them, even lost some close people, lost some opportunities, some regrets but still realising how much life can change in just a year is insane to me. 

Share some of your experiences too would love to read them. Also I am more positive and confident and in a better position for my papers this time. The only thing I want to change for next year is to have some new IRL friends, clear this exam and start working.

I talked almost 5 hours with a complete stranger on the phone and I dont regret 1 minute.,"I know the title sounds like I live in my moms basement, but hear me out. 

I listed my computer for sale because I bought a new one. Yesterday I ended up giving it to my neighbor and I received a call today from an elderly woman who was interested in buying it. (Yes, I didnt expect that.)
 I told her its not available anymore. She said thats okay she will keep looking for another one. At first I thought that she will put down the phone but she said she hates technology and never wanted a computer in the first place. I said yeah thats fair and she told me that her sister  in her homecountry has a computer and she wants to stay in touch and receive pictures of her nephews and the family. She is sick and she cant travel anymore. A drive from my country to the town is normally around 8h, because of the war, travelling is hard right now.

Right now I am sick and bored at home, so why not listen. I know old people like to ramble a bit but she actually sounded like she really hasnt talked with anybody in a while. She told me about her family and growing up without running water and electricity. About her son and living alone. About her husbands death and her job as a lawyer. And about how much she misses poland and her hometown. She hasnt been there for 20 years, her siblings visit her sometimes. She told me how much opportunities she had, living in a big city but she wants to be in isolation again, she fears progression and the fact that her family is so far away. We both grew up in catholic families, so I found it easy to connect with her on this.
She said things are moving so fast, she cant keep up with it. Mentally, she never really left her town and hopes that she is able to see it again. Epilepsy is making her life difficult, which also contributes to not travelling.
I have family in Mazowieckie and I really hope she gets to visit her birth place. Even though she moved voluntarily, she is very homesick. Her husband died years ago and since then she lives alone, but she would rather live alone in the middle of nowhere instead of a big city, because that makes her feel even more lonely. 

At the end of the phone call, I honestly told her that I hope we can talk again some day. The conversation with her was so refreshing and really made my day. I learned a lot in those 5 hours. And I am happy that I got to spend my time with this interesting person.

(He did a similar thing with a giant bag of treats but it was dark black poop from the dye.)

America/Europe obsession for entertainment,"I'm generalizing for the sake of my argument.

I lived a decade in the middle east and while people also entertain themselves here, at the end of the day their main preoccupation is to have food on their table.

 I live in Europe now and the living standards are much better, obviously. I noticed that some people live in such comfort that their main concern are video games or movies, taking entertainment up to an unhealthy level. There's always a controversy about a video game's character or a show episode like it's such a big deal. And this isn't limited to the internet, while discussing with people in real life, some talked to me about entertainment like it was such an important issue.

I mean just enjoy it, entertain yourself and move on, right? It's good to be passionate but at the end of the day it's just a movie/video game.

"My precious dog is going to another home, and my heart is breaking.","But it was me who left first. I left my home because of... painful circumstances, and my pitbull/am bully girl is being taken care of by my folks. I would go and visit her on Saturdays whenever I can. Her name is Kitkat, because of her milk chocolate fur.

My mom called me up. She said they can't handle Kitkat anymore. She's too energetic, too strong and scary looking. My relatives refused to visit the house because of her. Yesterday, she killed one of the chickens. It was the last straw for my dad. He .. he's going to impound my dog. 😭

I scoured facebook for anyone or any foundation to take her in, and surprisingly found one very quickly.

I'm happy she's going to a new and a better home. I want to  take her,  but my condo is strict about pets. 😢 
I'm happy she'll have a new family. At the same time my heart is crushed and broken into a thousand pieces, knowing I won't be able to see her on weekends. 


My precious Kitkat, my girl. Next Saturday will be the last time I'll see you. 😢 I love you my girl. I know I sound silly to other people, but I truly love you. My girl, my Kitkat. 😢 The next family is more wonderful. You will adjust in no time.

My boyfriend encouraged me to take the day off of work and upon asking why I learned that a good friend of mine contacted him earlier in the month asking to “conspire” (her words) on a semi-surprise party for me. 

(I say “semi-surprise” as they both knew they would have to let me clue in to get me to actually take the day off work)

Awake at 3am messing around in my room. Discovered(what I consider to be) a serious problem.,"So I'm a fresh high school graduate, and I have a few months of free time before I go to college.

Since I went to a boarding school, I didn't have a whole lot of free time to myself. Now I'm spending my nighttime free time reading random books and doing random things.

Tonight, I decided to look at myself in the mirror! Then I noticed something suprising, to me at least.

My hairline is receding! I'm barely 18! I find this to be a problem, because my hair grows VERY slowly. This means my hair isn't long enough to hide those bald spots!

This might not seem like a big problem, but to me it is! I've always wondered why my forehead looks huge from the side, and I never liked how it looks in pictures.

I did look at websites to see the kind of hairstyles for receding hairlines, but I want peoples' opinions. 

How do you deal with a receding hairline?

Do you have a go-to simple hairstyle for hiding it?

Some kid out there has no idea their whole life is a lie,"I was fishing one time at a state park not far from where I grew up. I caught a largemouth and was getting ready to throw it back it when this younger man politely asked me if I could keep it on the hook and gently toss it back in instead. 

He told me that his daughter was on her way to the park and he wanted her to “catch her first fish.” I didn’t see any harm in it and agreed. She arrived no more than a couple minutes later. 

He let some line out and handed her the pole. About a minute later she started to scream with excitement and yelled, “I got a fishy!” 

She reeled it in, took a picture and her dad released it back into the water. Her parents were so grateful that I honestly thought they were gonna cry.

My parents are adorable,"I just wanted to gush about my parents today. My mom and dad still treat each other like they just fell in love even after nearly 30 years of marriage. They both still get excited to see each other after work, they eat dinner together even if there's little to say that evening, and I especially love seeing them sitting together in the rose garden they've built together in their backyard. 

My dad is the embodiment of romance. Every week he comes home with flowers, never the same kind two weeks in a row, once a month he will come home with my mom's favorite food or cake, he plays guitar for her and sometimes sings beautiful love songs about growing old together or about when they first fell in love. 

They still go on dates together! They send me photos of themselves eating at restaurants, going on walks, shopping together and so much more. 

I don't know how to end this, but my parents love extends far beyond my siblings and I. All of my friends who grew up in shitty homes know what it's like to have parents. They know what it's like to come home to a warm hug and a hot plate of food, and the blessing of a safe place to go when there is nobody else to turn to.

Personally, one of the most interesting conversations I had was with a man I met on a train. We ended up talking about his experience living in a remote village in the Amazon rainforest and the challenges he faced there. It was fascinating to hear about a way of life that was so vastly different from my own.

I’ve been offered a fantastic role for a new company after feeling down on my luck for months at my current job!,"I can’t sleep from the excitement &amp; anxiety I’ve been experiencing since I heard about the great news, but I did it! 

I’ve been unhappy with my current job and, with no growth prospects in sight, I finally started applying for new roles a little over a month ago. 

These past two weeks have gone by so quickly, but I’m so happy to say that I’ve accepted a great role with a more senior title, a significant pay bump, and amazing benefits! 

I cannot wait to start this new chapter in my life, I’ve been so depressed in my current living situation and hearing that this new company *really* wants me onboard has been such an uplifting and overwhelming feeling. It’s currently 2am and I cannot sleep a wink 😆

I will say, I’m very nervous about putting in my notice for my current job - I love the people and the connections I’ve made, but clearly I needed to move forward from them. How do I make it so that they know I’m grateful for all they’ve provided for me, but I needed something they could not provide? I’d also like to know how to go about letting them know that a labor shortage is a huge issue they must address (essentially it’s a norm for everyone to “wear multiple hats,” but only be paid one job’s salary).

Weird food taste things that other people dont seem to taste,"Do you have some foods that taste strange or bad to you but when you speak about that to other people they dont seem to taste that? I think the common thing like cilantro tasting like soap is a classic example. Most people are familiar with that but there are other things for me that are less known.

Yes, cilantro tastes like soap to me. But I still like it in certain foods. 

Raw celery tastes like some kind of a bitter chemical to me. Not pleasant, definately not ""neutral, like crispy water"". Maybe if the water is from the pits of Chernobyl.

Liver tastes like ""liver"", and that taste makes me dry heave. 

And saffron tastes like plastic, exactly like what certain types of plastics that have that plastic smell smell like, that is what saffron tastes like. Nothing else. Not floral, not like honey, just like plastic. And I am talking of real saffron here, not fake saffron.

Brie Cheese has an extremely unpleasant chemical bitter taste to it, most notably in the grind. It clings to the inside of your mouth and ""stabs"" my tongue, its not a mere taste, it is a sensation like how chili is hot.

Saw the most beautiful view of the night sky I've ever seen in my life two weeks ago while camping!,"Since I was a kid, about ten years old maybe, I've always loved looking at the stars, Moon, the planets, and anything space related. While camping two weekends ago I saw the most beautiful view of the night sky I've ever seen in my life at 38 years old. I was out camping with two of my friends in New River Gorge National Park and we had the most favorable weather and viewing conditions you could ask for despite the forecast predicting lots of clouds. There were plenty of clouds throughout the day that made the Sun seem as if it was playing ""peek-a-boo"" but they eventually retreated entirely shortly before dusk like the sky was ready for its curtain call. And it was preparing to put on a beautiful show.

Our campsite was nestled on an old, washed out sandbar deep in a valley flanked on all sides by tall hills and adjacent to the ancient New River which has carved into the Appalachian Mountains for millennia. The mountainous hills around us, although not tell by Rocky Mountain standards, still rose to a high enough altitude to block a significant portion of our view of the sky around us while still leaving us with a spectacular sliver of space. The conditions for viewing the night sky were perfect since there wasn't a cloud in the sky, the Moon was but a small sliver of light low above the mountains, and an absence of light pollution save for the soft glow of the campfire. I was the first to notice Venus shining brightly even in the quickly fading amber sunset that was left hanging close to the Moon. My friends questioned me, ""how do you know that's Venus?"" and I explained to them how low it is over the horizon, how bright it is compared to everything else, and how it doesn't twinkle like stars do. With no cellular service to Google it, they took my word for it. 

Within an hour or so all sunlight was gone and darkness filled the entire valley revealing star after star after star. I pointed out different constellations to my friends including my favorite one, Orion. We sat and chilled for a couple hours constantly glancing at the amazing show above our heads until the both of them turned in for the night. Forever a night owl, I stayed up for a couple hours more taking in the sky by myself sitting next to the campfire keeping going during the chilly low-to-mid-40's night and a lantern if I needed it. When I finally let the fire die I was enveloped in some of the darkest darkness I can remember. The darkness was mixed with an eery quietness with the only sound coming from the rapids of the New River creating a nice white noise to help go to sleep. There were no crickets, frogs, or other creatures making noise since it was too early for them to be active. There was an occasional train rolling through the tracks on the other side of the river hundreds of yards away that was pulling cars for hauling coal which were full when heading in one direction and empty heading back. With no railroad crossings close by the train didn't blow its horn but we could still hear is coming from a mile or more away. 

But that's the story of the most beautiful night sky I've ever seen.

"after renting a home and having to take care of it, a condo seems more appealing then it was 3 years ago","Heyy Reddit

I've been renting a house for about 3 years now, since 2020. I am a single parent, and have to take care of basically everything like yard  matience and gutter cleaning. 

I lived in houses my whole life, I never lived in an apartment until I got my first place at 20. This is not because my parents are rich, but because there are not really any apartments in rural Canada in the 1990s. Many time I've herd discussions about how terrible condos and apartments are for sharing walls/spaces. When I was 20 I moved into a city and was pumped to be in an apartment.

Life moved on and I became a parent, and at 26 in 2020 while the housing market skyrocketed I found a house in the county at a cheaper rent then my apartment. My apartment did not have a balcony or any outside space. I went from that to a 3 bedroom house with a fenced in yard. I got an electric lawnmower and figured I'd have a blast. It was awesome with covid to take my kid out without having to be sharing space with strangers.

Taking care of a house is so much work. This house is older and not insulated well and all utilities are insane. Cleaning gutters is worse then you think. Having a garden or doing lawn maintenance is physical work, and hard. electric problems, door locking problems, we had an ice storm and trees went down in the back yard and that was all on me to clean. I moved at early covid so no painting or anything outside of emergency services was done to the house before I moved in, and just recently in 2023 had the landlord come in to check the smoke alarms and c02 dectors, and apparently I have no c02 dector. I thought that one of our smoke alarms was a c02 as well. Did they give me one? No. Apparently it is up to me to purchase one, and I was in this house with my child without one for years. In any apartment I've rented men would physically come into my apartment to check the alarms.

Home rental is very hard, I'm sure home ownership is so much harder. I am going to move back into an apartment in the summer. Idk if I will ever be able to buy anything, but if I do, I will be looking at condos and not houses.",GarbageWay,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/12f8bgi/after_renting_a_home_and_having_to_take_care_of/,heyy reddit renting house 3 year since 2020 single parent take care basically everything like yard matience gutter cleaning lived house whole life never lived apartment got first place 20 parent rich really apartment rural canada 1990s many time herd discussion terrible condo apartment sharing wall space wa 20 moved city wa pumped apartment life moved became parent 26 2020 housing market skyrocketed found house county cheaper rent apartment apartment balcony outside space went 3 bedroom house fenced yard got electric lawnmower figured blast wa awesome covid take kid without sharing space stranger taking care house much work house older insulated well utility insane cleaning gutter worse think garden lawn maintenance physical work hard electric problem door locking problem ice storm tree went back yard wa clean moved early covid painting anything outside emergency service wa done house moved recently 2023 landlord come check smoke alarm c02 dectors apparently c02 dector thought one smoke alarm wa c02 well give one apparently purchase one wa house child without one year apartment rented men would physically come apartment check alarm home rental hard sure home ownership much harder going move back apartment summer idk ever able buy anything looking condo house,renting home take care condo seems appealing wa 3 year ago,garbage way
The Friday newspaper.,"(apologies in advance for bad English)
I think I am one of the few people who were born in the 2000's and have a fond memory with something as old and boring as a newspaper. My father had a subscription to a newspaper called Al-Ahram ""The pyramids"", he was subscribed to a special edition called ""The Friday Ahram"" which comes with three papers, one for usual news but thicker since it's for the whole week, one for all the news about the cars in Egypt, and a small one with the edition's name. The last one wasn't really for news but for writers, poets and cartoonists. The last two were the ones which peaked my interest. The guy who delivered them would usually come at 9-10 A.M, my dad would take the papers and sit in the living room to read them. Then I would ask him to let me read the other two, he usually didn't mind. I would take them and start reading, the one about cars would get me bored really quickly, it was too analytic for 6-year-old me, I would quickly hop on the other one. It consisted of short stories, poems, and various cartoons that reflects on the life. But little me didn't understand it and didn't care, he was only there for the stories and cartoons that looked both exciting and funny. I would speedrun through the paper because I have to be prepared for Friday prayer. Sometimes I fail and I would be sitting impatient in the Masjid waiting for it to end so that I can return and continue reading. Then my dad had to travel abroad for work and took us with him, by the time we returned there was no point to get the subscription again since news is always available on the internet... I really miss that newspaper... Maybe I should get that edition for one last time.",ahmedatrees2003,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/12feydu/the_friday_newspaper/,apology advance bad english think one people born 2000 fond memory something old boring newspaper father subscription newspaper called al ahram pyramid wa subscribed special edition called friday ahram come three paper one usual news thicker since whole week one news car egypt small one edition name last one really news writer poet cartoonist last two one peaked interest guy delivered would usually come 9 10 dad would take paper sit living room read would ask let read two usually mind would take start reading one car would get bored really quickly wa analytic 6 year old would quickly hop one consisted short story poem various cartoon reflects life little understand care wa story cartoon looked exciting funny would speedrun paper prepared friday prayer sometimes fail would sitting impatient masjid waiting end return continue reading dad travel abroad work took u time returned wa point get subscription since news always available internet really miss newspaper maybe get edition one last time,friday newspaper,ahmed tree 2003

Finally done for the evening.,"My husband informed me before he left work today that his parents are coming over tomorrow. I did not get the house as clean as I would have liked, but I'm not embarrassed for my mother in law to see it.

"I wanted to send this text to my step mom but, no, so I’m gonna just say it here cause I need this out of my body."," Ok.  So. 

Step mom texts me about the restaurant she’s at: “food is good but waitress is a ditz” I say everyone has off nights. She says “yeah but she was just not good”. While my dad is texting me separately (they’re both together at the restaurant) and is asking me how to tip the chefs and kitchen staff.

This just pissed me off so badly because I’m almost certain that this poor waitress wasn’t nearly as bad as Sharon said she was. And now she’s making my dad not tip the waitress.  My step mom is a hellish person to be near to. She will make you feel like a piece of dog shit for existing in her presence. And how fucking dare you breathe.  Like that. 

Anyways.  She texts me about the service and my dads texting me separately and I’m just seeing this whole thing play out like two fucking ass holes trying to bully some poor waitress because they’re miserable in their own hearts. (Not my dad, but my step mom is for sure). 

So I wrote this whole thing out. But like. Obviously I’m not going to send it, but I guess I just wanted someone to hear it. Sharon doesn’t even deserve to know what true friendship is. Here’s the text that was never sent, cause what kind of psycho sends this shit:

“Yeah I feel for the waitresses. One time at Hawthornes by my dads old condo where I used to work. It was like my 3rd day and I had a party table of 16 people and simultaneous 2/3/4 tops on the patio and one table inside. Table inside couldn’t see the patio and thought they were the only ones in the restaurant.  The table inside left me a penny as a tip and wrote a scathing note on the bill.  I was so upset and started sobbing as I typed it into the computer in the kitchen. One of the older waitresses saw me and took me out back with the recycling and gave me an empty beer bottle and said “throw it” and we both smashed a couple empty beer bottles on the ground in the dumpster area and hugged it out. She hugged me and told me people are assholes. 

The couple that gave me a $.01 tip came back a month or so later and I was their server again (I recognized them immediately and was like fuck my life) but I treated them well and kept my chin up and they left me a good tip and pulled me aside and said thanks for the good service.  I always think about that when I judge my servers. They’re probably trying so hard and you can’t see the other things they have going on.”

Ugh I hate when people are rude to other people!!!!!! AAAAAAAHHHHH

My classmate at the dance studio complimented my dancing and I feel so happy.,"I love dancing to hell and back, but I definetely could be better at it. I've done it from age 2 all the way to 16, and, in those last few years, I grew very insecure about my dancing and constantly compared myself to the other girls at the studio. I had even had dreams about going professional for a while, but decided I just didn't have the talent for it and it deeply saddened me.

After years away, I finally picked it back up in January of last year, at 19. I'm now in college and see dancing as a big passion I take very seriously, and that could eventually become a sort of secondary career. For now, though, I just want to improve and have fun doing what I love. After a few months being the oldest at junior level, I was kind of forced to quickly jump to the adult level due to class time and availability. Teacher said he would trust me to keep up, and I went for it.

I've been with them since August. I'm nothing special, but I have improved. I love what I do and it pushes me to do my best. Still, no one ever really notices my dancing or compliments it - I'm kind of just there. But my classmate did last Wednesday. While I was stretching before class, she came to me and said she wanted to talk. She said she had grown to admire me a lot and find me inspiring for putting in so much effort. ""When you came to our class, you had to adapt very quickly and had a lot to learn, but you've improved so much in such little time, and you are now doing very well"". She said she had recently gone out with some of our other classmates and they mentioned me: ""everyone agreed you are very hardworking and we all like you a lot"". 

I felt so happy. It is the nicest thing I've heard about my dancing by a country mile, and coming from someone who knows what they are talking about and is a good dancer herself. I not nearly as insecure as I once was, and rely much less on external validation now - dancing is my truth and I know there's space for me, even if I'm not the greatest. But it's still my art, and my purpose doing it is still to tell a story and make my audience feel something. Knowing that I'm actually getting better at it... it just feels so unbelievably nice.

Deeply Personal Conversations with Random Strangers,"What is it that makes people so willing to freely divulge personal information to random strangers? Why is it that people will share more with someone they don't know than someone they know? I recently experienced the beauty of this phenomenon twice in two weeks. The first encounter was with an Uber driver, the second with a person on the bus.

For context, I’m 26M and I’ve recently found myself on a journey of self discovery. I’ve been thinking about myself and my past, uncovering dirty truths that I kept bottled away for many years, and learning to reconnect with my emotions. In short, I’m healing my past traumas, and transforming into a new person. I haven’t been seeing a therapist but I have someone else who is very supportive in my life that I think is working even better (love you!).

So, here I am at midnight calling an Uber to go home as I have work the next day. The driver (40M) shows up and I get in the car. It’s about a 15 minute drive, and the driver immediately sparks up a conversation. He calls me by my first name a couple times which shows his interest in engaging with me, so I accept the invitation and we start talking. He asked me about how things are going tonight, and I said, “things are turbulent”. Right away he starts talking about his own life, as if it was about to burst out of his chest and he was just waiting for the right person to come along who was willing to listen.

He told me about a health condition that prevents him from sleeping and causes him daily physical pain, which is why he spends his nights as an Uber driver. He told me about his relationship problems. He told me about the guilt he feels over the way he treated people in the past that were close to him. He told me about his child that died at the age of two. It was painful to listen to. I could tell that he was in a lot of pain, and there was nothing I could do except listen and validate his feelings. Perhaps that’s all he wanted. “Perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to be understood.”

I decided to share my story as well, in short form as we didn’t have much time. I described feeling lost in the world, not knowing who I am or what I want. I explained I didn’t love myself and that I didn’t feel worthy. I explained I felt very ill equipped to deal with all of these new emotions I was feeling that I had previously repressed. These are topics I wouldn’t share even with my own parents… and yet here I am telling a random stranger about my deepest insecurities. But somehow it felt safe. That’s the word I would use…. safe. It felt safe to share because I knew there was nothing he could do with that information to hurt me. There was no baggage between us, no history, and so the dynamic of the conversation was one of brutal honesty.

As we were approaching our destination, I asked my driver one final question: “I feel so overwhelmed. What do I do now? Where do I start?”

He gave me one piece of advice that I’m never going to forget: “Start with one thing. JUST ONE THING! And see it through to the end.”

And that’s been my approach to life ever since. To take it one step at a time, and to deeply explore each individual problem as it comes so that I can gain as many insights as possible about the situation/feeling/whatever it is. How can you ever hope to make a meaningful and lasting change if you don’t understand the thing you’re changing?

The Uber driver gave me his number and just a few days ago I texted him to say hi. We agreed we would go for a coffee sometime… but only when it feels right, which could be months down the road, could be years, I don't know.

I’m not sure why it took me 21 years to realize how essential small talk is…what are your thoughts on small talk?,"I’ll be turning 22 in a few days and I’ve been reflecting on how I’m growing into an “adult” and how I’m maturing and I realized how much better I’ve become at small talk and how much more willingly i engage in it. I think it’s because I’ve come to realize how important human connection is not only for health but just for life and moving about the world. You need other people. You can’t climb to the top by yourself. It’s crazy to me because I used to hate all small talk, I despised it. I’m pretty introverted and used to be very overprotective of my privacy, which I still am more than most, but now I don’t mind giving a little of myself to connect.  I have come to believe that anyone in your life you see on a semi regular basis you should have some type of rapport with. An example could be the barista at your coffee shop you frequent, or a personal example is my maintenance man. I live in a huge apartment building and I started making small talk with this maintenance man and now he is like a Grandfather figure to me. He has helped me in some of the most difficult situations I’ve been in, when I’ve been sick, car issues and accidents, whatever I need he’s been there. And I would’ve missed out on such an amazing human in my life if I never said hello ya know?

"what would you like to have at an easter brunch, and what do you think should absolutely NOT be at an easter brunch?","TL;DR: i’m going to an easter brunch and have no idea what i should/shouldn’t bring 

the context: i’m a masters student in europe and have been invited to a casual easter brunch this weekend where we have all been asked to bring something. i’ve never attended an easter brunch as i’ve come from a different culture, and i’m really not sure what i should make. 

the situation: there will be around 15 people in attendance, the meal will happen around midday, there are multiple people who will be vegetarian and vegan, and no one has any gluten intolerances or peanut/other allergies.

my ideas: i was originally thinking of doing something potato-related, like home fries or hash browns or potato pancakes since i feel like a nice salty and seasoned potato dish is always appreciated at any time of day. but i could also bring something like a drink, like strawberry mint lemonade or something else that is refreshing? fresh fruit is kind of expensive here, but i could do something with frozen fruit? an option could also be to get some chips and make some dips, but i don’t currently know many good chip dip recipes and am also not sure if this is appropriate for an easter brunch. i could also do a salad or something else vegetable-based just to have something “healthy” at the brunch? 

so yeah, any ideas? what is something you would love to have at an easter brunch, or maybe something where you would be sad if it wasn’t there? and what should i definitely not bring? thanks for your help! :)",baby_spinach_fiend,15,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/12erubx/what_would_you_like_to_have_at_an_easter_brunch/,tl dr going easter brunch idea bring context master student europe invited casual easter brunch weekend asked bring something never attended easter brunch come different culture really sure make situation around 15 people attendance meal happen around midday multiple people vegetarian vegan one ha gluten intolerance peanut allergy idea wa originally thinking something potato related like home fry hash brown potato pancake since feel like nice salty seasoned potato dish always appreciated time day could also bring something like drink like strawberry mint lemonade something else refreshing fresh fruit kind expensive could something frozen fruit option could also get chip make dip currently know many good chip dip recipe also sure appropriate easter brunch could also salad something else vegetable based something healthy brunch yeah idea something would love easter brunch maybe something would sad definitely bring thanks help,would like easter brunch think absolutely easter brunch,baby spinach fiend
Is it normal for friends to grow apart? I feel as though I do not have much in common with my old high school friends.,"I'm 20 in college and it's my birthday soon. My friends from high school invited me to go out with them the weekend after my birthday. However, I feel like I don't really know them anymore. During high school, I wasn't really close with a lot of them and didn't really like them. I didn't hate them, I just never clicked with them. We had different interests and attitudes back then, and still do today. I feel like an asshole though for not wanting to go, but I don't really don't want to. Maybe it'd be cool to catch up with them, but again, I'm not too interested. I haven't seen some of them in 2 years.

I also have midterms right after that weekend and I'm probably going to need that to study.

2 of my best friends won't be going either. One moved away a while ago, and another one is busy working. I drifted further away from them too, which sucks. One I still feel close with, even though I haven't called in a while if that makes sense. And I love hanging out with the other one when I go back home but he works alot.

I'm going to be a Dad by next weekend!!!,"The countdown has begun! We had our 38 week appointment yesterday, and the Dr told us to get scheduled for an induction next Wednesday! 

This is our first child (a girl) and while the overall pregnancy flew by, these last few weeks have been like watching a pot boil... It seemed like she was going to come late if anything, so even though it's only a few days before the due date it still feels ""early"" for some reason...

I can't wait to meet her, and the house has been ready for weeks, but for whatever reason hearing the words ""scheduled for induction"" just made me have this instant feeling of ""Holy crap we have so much stuff to still get done."" even though we don't.

A guy that nobody thought would amount to anything proved me and several others wrong.,"I used to go to school with a guy who really struggled. He was having to repeat several classes, and he was having to do a lot of night school to try to pass his classes. Some kids even used to joke that if we had a “Most likely to fail”, he would get that. 

He didn’t have a job as far as I knew, and in my mind at the time, I didn’t think he would be able to keep one. He was socially awkward. I’m not making fun of him. I’m just stating what I observed.

I recently saw him a few weeks ago. He was managing a Burger King. I asked him how he was doing and he said he’s been working a lot and just celebrated 10 years working at Burger King.

What to get myself for my anniversary - fun or practical?,"My wife and I have a deal where, for our anniversary, we get our own gifts instead of getting gifts for each other. Only for our anniversary, all other gifts are normal. Normally I just get myself something fun, like a toy or video game or something. But this year I'm thinking maybe I get myself something practical that I also do want, and arguably need: a beard trimmer.

&amp;#x200B;

Argument A: There's a beard trimmer that I really want. It looks great, and I need one, because my beard is usually unkempt. And I'm not allowed to shave it, because according to my wife, I look like I'm about 13 years old without a beard. 

Argument B: That's not really fun. I have a couple toys that I also really want, already picked out and that's about 25% cheaper than the beard trimmer. I already have a nice body hair trimmer that I could use to trim my beard but I choose not to. So:

B1: I could just use my body hair trimmer to fix my beard. Problem is that's not as convenient, or as exciting. And I could have been doing it all along and haven't so...the likelihood that I would do it seems low. But I could!

Can't believe I have to say this in a sub called casual conversations, but previous posts have proven that I do so: PLEASE DON'T BE AN ASSHOLE.

"after months of radio silence from employers, i feel like i just hit the jackpot on jobs","TL;DR at the end

i was the type of kid that just goofed off, partied, and didnt do jack shit in high school, and my grades reflected that (gpa: ~2.2 IIRC) and i never planned on going to college bc i never thought i could handle it, and i never had any professional passions/aspirations

fast forward to 2020 ive been graduated so im working but then the pandemic hits, i was in trade at the time and my company worked in hospitals so i “got laid off” (they finally reached back to me a few months ago, gee thanks…) so i decided “fuck it” and enrolled in community college. ive been continuing to take classes since, and ive been unemployed throughout this time

fast forward to about a year ago and i was invited to join Phi Theta Kappa, which is the international honors society for community college students. this was the first time in my life id been given an academic honor like this

i still dont feel like i really have an *incredibly* strong goal for my career (ive had a looong history of flip flopping) but ive been drawn towards the general idea of working with computers, and sometimes more specifically adobe software/graphic arts and picture/video editing

my graphic arts artstyle is pretty surreal/bold/non professional though and when i wasnt learning to use these softwares through making art it was through making memes, so i really dont have anything to show off my abilities to employers for that

because of my tendency to flip flop and my lack of a clear vision, i decided to just go for a general studies degree

i only have 1 class left until graduation and im currently in the middle of it, so ive been applying to basically any job thats not service/fast food and in several months time i was only able to land 1 potential interview, which fell through before we got to the in-person stage unfortunately

that was, until i started going through the process of getting hired by the people who actually hired me. 

i applied to be a entry level marketing consultant, and i already felt underqualified for that. BUT APPARENTLY THEY FELT DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE THEY HIRED ME AS A “MANAGER IN TRAINING”

#WHAT????

to be fair, i think the interview went incredibly well. turns out, the guy who was interviewing me (who i believe is going to be my boss) was really into using adobe software as a hobby as well! he said his artstyle was inspired by anime, and that he loves anime. i told him that i intend to continue to grow my skills with adobe as im with the company, whether inside or outside of work, as i intend to one day have a career relating to that, and he seemed to really like the idea.

My business is going under and I'm actually glad!,"I've been running a vacant land business for about 2 years now. Basically, I buy vacant land, fix it up, install septic/utilities, and then sell it.

I got into this business by accident over the pandemic and it did well, so I continued it for the past 2 years. But lately, it started going under and I found myself glad. This business has been really stressful, and I've always wanted to do something different. But my dad taught me to take advantage of opportunities like this as you'll never know when you'll have another successful business. So I did and granted, he was somewhat right as I was able to save up money and get out of a bad financial situation. 

But now that it's going under I'm excited about what's next. I'm going to keep a piece of land for my self and build a tiny house! I also think I'm going to go back to school for teaching.

Peacock has so much missed potential to be a good streaming service,"For those who don't know, Peacock is a streaming service by Comcast that launched July 15th, 2020 and has 20 million subscribers as of writing this. From what I heard, it is kinda useless and that's kinda surprising since Comcast owns Universal and Universal is famous for its great movies. How did they mess up a streaming service about Universal?

If you search ""Peacock movies"" you can see movies like MEGAN and Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, but it looks like those are the most notable movies on the platform (At least to me). I feel like they could have added classic movies Universal owns like Jurassic Park, Child's Play, and Fast &amp; Furious to the platform.

As for new movies, well movies like Nope have been released to the platform 45 days after the theatrical release... Only to move to another platform like Amazon Prime after 4 months, and then move back to Peacock after ten months to be on it for 4 months again.

Overall, Comcast is missing the opportunity to make it known as ""The Universal streaming service"" by not putting its classic movies or even bad movies like Shark Tale which are being watched on Netflix a lot right now. I hope they realize this in the future because it could up there with Disney+ and HBOMax as one of the top streaming services.",TubbybloxianIsBack,5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/12ej61i/peacock_has_so_much_missed_potential_to_be_a_good/,know peacock streaming service comcast launched july 15th 2020 ha 20 million subscriber writing heard kinda useless kinda surprising since comcast owns universal universal famous great movie mess streaming service universal search peacock movie see movie like megan pus boot last wish look like notable movie platform least feel like could added classic movie universal owns like jurassic park child play fast amp furious platform new movie well movie like nope released platform 45 day theatrical release move another platform like amazon prime 4 month move back peacock ten month 4 month overall comcast missing opportunity make known universal streaming service putting classic movie even bad movie like shark tale watched netflix lot right hope realize future could disney hbomax one top streaming service,peacock ha much missed potential good streaming service,tubby b lo xian back

I wanna know what it’s like to go out and talk to people or meet like minded people or anything really. I don’t have any form of credit, all I’ve ever payed anything for is with debit.

I quit my job today.,"I work for an agency and they've sent me to some warehouse to work at for the past few weeks. I've been enjoying it so far. Easy work, nice people. 

Recently the agency asked me if I want to work on the national bank holidays. This Friday and Monday. I said yeah because some more money in my pocket is nice and honestly I forgot that these bank holidays were even coming up.

Anyway today the boss brought all the agency staff in for a meeting. Apparently some said they're not going to work on the bank holiday, which is normal. It's a national holiday. But the boss gave this huge speech about how we're not in a cushy office job and they expect us to work the bank holiday otherwise they'll replace us.

Now I don't like threats at all. Been there done that kind of thing. So even though I was willing to work the bank holiday, I decided screw that. Finished work for the day, called the agency and told them I won't work there any more. Good luck to them getting someone to work on a bank holiday late notice, especially when they're not offering any extra pay or benefits.

I gave my neighbour a thank you card,"I'm currently staying at a small campground while I prepare to move.  Over the few months I've been here there's this guy who lives there and looks kinda intimidating (tattoos, bald, huge beard etc) and I was always nervous about walking past his place.  

One time I was walking past with my pup and he was leaving his trailer and he commented that he was a happy pup, and I was kinda surprised as he was so friendly and not gruff like I expected him to be.  A few weeks later, as Eddy and I were walking past his place again, Eddy saw the park owner/manager and started barking up a storm because he wanted to say hi, and the guy was heading out and stopped to say that I was doing a great job with Eddy and that he was lucky to have me.  It was a small compliment but it really made my week and helped me realize that I was actually doing great with Eddy's training. 

I'm moving soon, so I thought I should make a card for this guy and thank him for his kind words.  I thought it was too much, but I figured I only have one life and if I can do something nice I should do it.  So I made the card (and a few more for other people here that I've met) and I went over.  Let me say here that I was SO nervous, but I knew I'd be upset at myself if I didn't overcome my anxiety about talking to new people so I phsyched myself up and said a prayer and marched over.  

I knocked on the door and he took the card, and then I asked him to sign my book which is a sort of memory scrapbook in which people I've met can write a little note or something for me to remember them by.  He invited me in while he wrote a small note and then we ended up talking for over 30 minutes.   He's actually a super nice guy and he had so many interesting things to share.  I learned about his dogs and his family and kids, and it was just a really great conversation. 

One of the things that I'll always remember from our conversation is what he said about living.  He said: you don't need a lot to be happy, and if you're in a situation that makes you unhappy, take some paper and figure out what it is and find ways to change it.

I'm so glad that I got over my fear and gave him the card.

I’m five miles south of the Grand Canyon and I’m stuck in mud waiting for a winch-out.,"We decided to take a family road trip for spring break and rented an RV to camp our way to and from the Grand Canyon from SoCal. Things have been a little hairy so far (little kids need lots of stops, no working water in the RV, very cold weather) but we’ve been making it work. 

Until we left our dispersed camping site for the Grand Canyon. We got about 50 feet before we got stuck in mud up to the axle. Chalk it up to inexperience I guess. 

I have barely any signal but was able to get connected finally to a tow service that should be able to winch us out. They’re in theory about an hour away but who knows. At least I actually spoke to the guy who’s coming so I know help will come eventually. Going to be very expensive but we don’t really have any choice and also we’re fortunate enough we’ll be able to cover it. 

We’re within walking distance of a main highway so if worse comes to absolute worst we can flag someone down out there. We have food, water, and warmth. We are not in any real danger. Just a serious pain in the ass and kinda humiliating. 

So my kids are watching TV, my wife is cooking us second breakfast for lunch, and we’re just waiting for rescue.

They fired me due to my dog being “too loud” (he literally whined once and no one heard him cause I asked my trainer and she said she heard nothing) 
And also me calling off one day of work, and working 2 half days. 
My first half day I had a fever of 99 degrees and I didn’t leave until my trainer told me not to overwork myself. 
The second day I called off completely because I was non stop vomiting. 
Today I called off after an hour because I threw up on my desk during training. 

After I filled out the call out form I got a call from one of my bosses and they said they were letting me go because my dog was too loud and distracting customers- catch is? 
I never even got to take a single customer. 

Honestly I don’t blame them and my trainer was PISSED OFF that they fired me for being sick and has told me not to feel guilty but I can’t help but feel like I’ve disappointed my fiancée (M24). I did talk to him and he said he was pissed that they didn’t at least give me a warning Instead of straight up firing me.",Magical_Malerie,38,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/12drita/i_got_fired_today/,started work home job day ago maybe week ago wa still training fired due dog loud literally whined one heard cause asked trainer said heard nothing also calling one day work working 2 half day first half day fever 99 degree leave trainer told overwork second day called completely wa non stop vomiting today called hour threw desk training filled call form got call one boss said letting go dog wa loud distracting customer catch never even got take single customer honestly blame trainer wa pissed fired sick ha told feel guilty help feel like disappointed fiancée m24 talk said wa pissed least give warning instead straight firing,got fired today,magical male rie

"I just joined the global top 0.1% in wealth/income, kinda by accident","I met my now wife during the pandemic, when lockdowns in my country were lifted for a brief period between the 1st and 2nd COVID waves. At the time she was a ""migrant worker"" from a country that my country would expect to be poorer, and the circumstance of how we met would have fit well on an expose of fetlife encounters. Nothing you'd want to share with the kids and parents that is.

Welp, turns out she is from a ridiculously well-to-do background; and I now having married her, never have to step in an office for another day in my life if I didnt want to. And I had no idea (edit: at first), because she lives like a regular jane, spending next to nothing on her appearance or experiences, &amp; living in shared apartments in a basic part of the city. Everything is shored up in stocks and assets earning 7 figures in interest every year.

And though she barely spends a penny on herself, her love language is giving. Meaning she showers me daily with the types of food I could only afford occasionally before; clears my credit card for me each month and we'll be moving to a landed property and getting cars I only could dream about before. Soon, that is (once we settle opening accounts and transferring stuff here).

I write here because I dont know who to share this with. I CANT tell. My best friend knows, but I know its not a smart idea to tell others about what we have. Jealousy, fake friends, demands, etc. Strangely enough, my bff (a girl) is also on track to marry into a literal conglomerate family. Like beyond even my situation (she also kindof just fell into it unknowingly). They say you share a karmic journey with the friends you meet in life.

For now we are just living like normal, but soon things will change. Its all a lot to digest too because I went from an independent, working pleb who expected to be the main breadwinner into basically a trophy husband.

I've finally collected all pieces I need to build a Lego Death Star,"The last package I need should be in the mailbox right now. This is a set I've been wanting to build for years and I should be really excited... but I promised myself I'd do my taxes first and I'm really not looking forward to that. 😞

I started a few months ago when I found a fantastic deal that had about 3000 of the total pieces for only around $250. (The Death Star seems to sell for over $1k for new-in-box, and around $600 for used and _mostly_ complete.)

Unfortunately I still needed about 1000 pieces still, so I started digging through the bins of my local second-hand Lego store and managed to find a majority of the remaining pieces for only $30!

For the more specialized and rare pieces.... I ordered those off of Bricklink dot com, and the price shot up to over $200 for those last few handfuls of Lego.

I'm 22 and graduating this May,"Honestly, I'm just tired. I feel burnt out and so much pressure. I'm also very excited and nervous because I know my life will be changing quite drastically, but on top of that I will have to heal a broken heart. I knew being an adult was not going to be easy, but not in the ways I expected. It's hard to plan after college, I may just cry the next time someone asks what I'm doing after college, and where I'm moving to. It's hard to know, I have goals I'm going to go for, but I know in the end I'll never know where life will take me, so I don't want to be set in my ways. 

I'm graduating with a graphic design degree, which I'm excited to be doing something in the digital art world. I just wish I knew what to expect in the working world, because I know it's different than college. I'm scared of being stuck in my hometown for awhile after college. I'm pretty sure I have imposter syndrome which isn't helping anything. 

I'm going in a big trip in June which I'm VERY excited for, and I have a hard time admitting this but I feel like I deserve it after how hard I've worked and I deserve a break. Also I don't know how much this will mess with job searches. It's just really intimidating not having the comfort of school anymore and I'm so freaked out with how fast time is going and I can't find any way to slow it down. 

At the end of the day I keep telling myself that the rest of this year I will have a lot of growth, getting over fears, and I'm going to figure out a lot about myself, and I can't wait to take all of my fears head on. 

For now, I hope this summer I'll keep my part-time job and just get paid to do murals around my city for a bit while I get my shit together. Hopefully I can create more design work, and keep making my portfolios better. 

Just to point out, I am very thankful for all of my opportunities I have and I am not taking anything for granted, but I want to make the people who helped me get here proud. I'm just not handling this well at all. 

I just needed to get some of this off of my chest, I also wanted to hear about your lives after school and the unexpected directions life took you.",hair_of_fire,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/12ecgyl/im_22_and_graduating_this_may/,honestly tired feel burnt much pressure also excited nervous know life changing quite drastically top heal broken heart knew adult wa going easy way expected hard plan college may cry next time someone asks college moving hard know goal going go know end never know life take want set way graduating graphic design degree excited something digital art world wish knew expect working world know different college scared stuck hometown awhile college pretty sure imposter syndrome helping anything going big trip june excited hard time admitting feel like deserve hard worked deserve break also know much mess job search really intimidating comfort school anymore freaked fast time going find way slow end day keep telling rest year lot growth getting fear going figure lot wait take fear head hope summer keep part time job get paid mural around city bit get shit together hopefully create design work keep making portfolio better point thankful opportunity taking anything granted want make people helped get proud handling well needed get chest also wanted hear life school unexpected direction life took,22 graduating may,hair fire
Someone I met on reddit thought I was a cat fisher and it was honestly the biggest confidence booster,"Last night I was on my local r4r and I messaged someone who had an interesting post up. We got to talking and realized we had a lot in common, one of those things being tattoos. 

She asked to see a pic of mine which I was happy to show off. Bear in mind, I have a full piece on my chest so I had to be shirtless. A few minutes went by without a response and then - 

“There’s no way that’s you lol send me your real pics” (and a bunch of other equally positive things)

Took me a second but I immediately had the biggest smile on my face. I assured her it was me and I could verify however she wanted. She gave me her snap and we’re meeting this weekend!

Y’all, it was such a compliment to be thought of as faking pics but that’s just your actual body, I can’t even fully describe it.

"I started listening to Queen, Aerosmith and others songs and really like the vibes.","English isn't my native language so it takes me time to vibe with any English song. I heard Dream On on a video and searched for it on Spotify. It went to shuffle on default and I have listened to so many new songs these past couple of days. At first I didnt get most of them but I would go back to listening them again and again. They pump me up so good especially when I am doing chores. I love trying to lip sync with them but half of the time I can't haha. They also make me try to just vibe dance.

I know they are big bands like Pink Floyd, Nirvana, Rolling Stones but before this I haven't heard any of their songs fully. I dont even know in what genre they fall in. I know I sound like a true dumbass here but I am not a big music listener. I just feel nice after listening to them. They just feel so different from other songs that I usually listen to.

Even now I am listening to that shuffle play and vibe dancing on my bed. Life doesnt feel so bad

I saw her legs and said “oh! You don’t have sand dunes on your legs??” And my mom had a visible doubt on her face. Then I showed her my thighs and said “see I have sand dunes on my legs!”

"I’m obsessed with mixing drinks, but I don’t want to drink alcohol","Hey guys. I’m a 19 year old college student in the U.S. and I’ve been really, really interested in mixology lately.

Before I go on, I am not of legal drinking age, and I have not ever had alcohol nor do I intend to…probably. I’ve been thinking about how interesting the drink combinations seem and suddenly turning 21 doesn’t seem so bad. At the same time, though, I dunno.

I just find the concept of mixing interesting. Coffee and tea, to an extent, but spirits are really where it feels like you have room to play with flavor. I’ve never been good with cooking, as much as I enjoy watching Babish on YouTube, but the idea of crafting flavor on a plate or in a glass is very fascinating to me. I just don’t know how I can step into that area if I don’t have any interest in the alcohol itself. My family is pretty against it and the last relative I had to tempt fate needed a liver transplant to survive, so I’m pretty sure I won’t be touching the stuff. It just seems a shame that an area so deep and full of potential is inaccessible if you don’t want the buzz. What do you guys think?

I know that there’s “zero-proof” stuff and mocktails and such, but based on my research a good amount of it just seems like a juicy sugar bomb rather than a complex flavor to enjoy, and while those can be fun it’s not really what I’m after.

"Today is my 21st birthday and I have no friends to celebrate with. I'm not that sad about it, but part of me finds that in itself to be sad. I guess I just don't know how to feel about it.","I haven't had a friend since high school. The issue is me not 'putting myself out there.' I used to be really mentally unwell. Now I'm a lot better and can be ""normal""-ish, but I never leave the house aside from work or shopping. So it's totally my fault that I have no friends.

I honestly dread every birthday because I know I have no friends to have fun with. I pretty much just stay home, which is okay because I'm a total homebody. But I live with my parents so it feels a bit embarrassing. They're used to me being like this though...

The saddest birthdays so far were my 16th and my 18th, because those are the ""big ones"" in the USA, and I had no friends to celebrate it with. (*Edit: I'm laughing reading my post now, because I spent my 17th birthday in a psych ward, and somehow I still didn't find that one to be the saddest....lol)* Your 21st is actually supposed to be even bigger in the USA (legal drinking age = partying, bars, clubs, etc.). I guess I'm just sad that every milestone so far has been spent alone. But I love myself -- I am not bad company.

Today, for my birthday, I spent a ton of money getting a full-body massage because I always wanted to get one and I'm touch-deprived. It was relaxing, but not as much as I thought it would be, and it was kind of awkward. I'm still glad I did it though. The head massage was my favorite part; it makes me wish I had a loved one to play with my hair or massage my scalp. Things like massages for people like me are bittersweet, because, on one hand, it reminds you of the human intimacy you're missing, but, on the other hand, it does heal a part of your soul that's been crumbled to pieces from that chronic lack of intimacy.

It's late afternoon now and I'm laying in bed because the massage made me feel a little light-headed/sleepy and my legs still ache from yesterday's workout.

I don't have any plans for the evening. I am lucky that my family is planning on taking me somewhere fun this weekend, so please don't pity me! Tonight I'll probably just eat yummy food, maybe eat an edible, listen to good music, doodle, or work on my poems....not sure what else there is to do!

"The path never leaves you, even if it seems like you left it.","Going into college, I wanted to study psychology. But I had a pivotal moment, it occurred in seconds, which caused me to turn away from my desire, my knowing, my life purpose.

My mom had good intentions. 

But I needed her love and approval from such an untouched core wound at the time.   
So when she said, ""you don't want to be in that rat race, do you? Listening to people's problems all day..."" 

…I felt ashamed. 

Ashamed that, in fact, I did want to. And I didn’t see it the way she did, at all. I was fascinated by relational dynamics and the internal processes of people. I loved inspiring others to create what they want. Even then. 

But I couldn't bear to conflict with an approval rating from my mom. Studying psychology was not getting a good grade in her book.   
So I abandoned it. 

I traveled for five years. All while feeling my purpose was lost, and this created a lot of anxiety. I wasn’t aware of why. It was the butterfly nomad journey v1.0, in my early 20's. 

I can't say I regret that period.

I lived in Israel and worked at a dive club on the Red Sea in Eilat as a divemaster / dive guide. I logged hundreds of dives, made friends with the reliable show of garden eels and lion fish. I took countless trips across the border to the Sinai in Egypt, so many I needed extra pages installed in my passport. I was and am still proud of that.

I traveled by myself to Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand. I met a hot Italian named Marco on the island of Kho Phangan, long before it became a modern tantra capital. I ended up having a two year story with him, where I lived with him part-time in his camper traveling around Tuscany selling hand-loomed bead jewelry I made. The other part of the time we lived in his Mom's apartment with his recently divorced and angry at everything sister La Gianna, and his raisin of a grandmother, La Tosca. Tosca must have withered down to about 80 pounds as she got into her later years. I learned Italian, ate the best food ever, witnessed with astonishment daily dramas at the dinner table, and of course... there was tall, dark and sexy AF: Marco.

My travels took me to Nigeria, Benin and Kenya in Africa. I could write a whole novel about those six months in Lagos, eating fried plantain and yucca every day and learning to speak Pigeon English. I'm leaving and I'm not coming back = me go go. I'm leaving, and I'll return = me go come. How delightful! I lived in a company house with 5 Israelis. That's also when all my early childhood Hebrew school came in handy, and my Hebrew elevated to mildly conversational. Yes, I learned Hebrew in Nigeria. At Passover, they made me do the four questions and they were amazed that I could read the Hebrew and knew the melody! We all celebrated and it was a great moment. 

So no, I don't regret that I turned away from getting a degree in psychology. I can't say I regret providing acupuncture to 5000 people over 20 years either. I met amazing people, some of whom I remain in contact with, and a few I think of as a friend, or even family. I can't say I regret all the pain washing from so many people's faces. The depth of gratitude for those who I truly helped turn around aggravating, debilitating, and scary health issues. It was all a gift.

And here I am, in my home town, another full circle. I'm reflecting about the path of my life and realize all along I've been studying psychology. I never stopped. I just didn't go the collegiate path. 

My morning take-away: the path never leaves you, even if it seems like you left it.

Has anyone ever lived with someone like this? I feel like it might be common.,"The only indication they can ever give you, when you express a serious intent to discuss some circumstance about the living situation, is that they really don’t value your perspective as a roommate:

-sigh

-scoff

-rolling eyes

-flippant remark

The list goes on an on. And maybe they listen, but they never ever give you any amount of serious discussion, ever. Even 5% seriousness on a timeline would be worth more and appreciated more than this. And when I say a percentage I mean a percentage of the time your are talking serious about the living situation itself, qualms and quandaries with it, etc. There’s plenty of time for joking and not being serious! Don’t get me wrong here! 

…so you are constantly fighting tooth and nail in these discussions to express your thought processes. You have to fight to prevent them from cutting you off, and when you call them out for cutting you off, they deny it as supposedly their intent is ‘pure’ in some way, so the actions themselves and the speech and body language don’t matter at all, right? Since the intent or supposed intent is pure? Wrong!

…and when you finally get your thought process out because you fought so hard for them to listen to you without them cutting you off, at the end of you describing why you see something about the living situation a certain way, they’ll immediately use the argument card of “lecture” or “nice lecture” or “I don’t want a lecture right now”. 

They spend so much time deflecting your concerns and your perspective and value as a roommate that they’ll call you repetitive when they never listened initially. So you constantly have to come up with higher-definition ways of explaining the way you see it until they get angry.

What was the weirdest flex by a rich person?,"Might not qualify as the weirdest flex but certainly one of the most bad ass.

Kerry Packer was Australia’s richest man worth around 8 billion some 20 years ago. His gambling feats were legendary. He would often go to casinos and win or lose 10 million plus in one sitting. One time he won $26 million playing 6 hands of blackjack at $200,000 each. That’s $1.2 million per hand.

On top of that, whilst some of these may not be 100% accurate (Urban legends can get twisted over time) they all have some element of truth.

He’s been known to tip croupiers and waitresses 100s of 1000s of dollars and paying off their mortgages. Once he accidentally tipped a waitresses tray and apologised and arranged to pay her $100,000+ mortgage. Another time a dealer was offered an $80,000 tip by Packer but respectfully declined, informing him dealers are not allowed to accept gratuities. Packer called over the Pit Boss and demanded the dealer be sacked on the spot. The Pit Boss fired her. Packer then pushed forward the $80,000 worth of chips before demanding the Pit Boss re-hire her.

But then came the Texan oil tycoon coin flip…

Packer was playing every box at a blackjack table and not allowing anyone else to play or back bet at the table. This was a common practice by Packer and indeed a lot of big gamblers. But one time there was a braggart Texan oil baron throwing his weight around, complaining and telling all and sundry he was a big deal. He’s rich, he doesn’t have to wait for a table and who was this buffoon hogging it…Packer doesn’t walk around telling everyone how good he is and he doesn’t like people who do…

So Packer swivels around in his seat only for the Texan to double down, pointing his finger at the face of Packer and yelling some choice words finishing with, “I’m worth $100 million!” Packer slowly leans back in his chair, pulls a coin out of his pocket, stares at the Texan and calmly says, “So you want to gamble hey? I’ll flip you for it.” He was serious.

As the Texan quietly slunk away into the shadows, Kerry turned back to the table and continued like nothing had happened.

I’m pretty sure I botched my interview,"Two days ago I interviewed for a position that would, honestly, be life changing. The starting salary was more money than I’ve ever made in my life and I would have just been happy being offered that. 

I went in already knowing I didn’t have the degree they wanted, but I had 12 years of experience in the field (it’s kitchen, but more of corporate/dietary position). It was the first time I was interviewed by a table of 6 people, and it was done over Zoom (which I’ve never used because I didn’t ever have a reason during the pandemic). I used a 6 year-old IPad that belonged to my 5 year old niece for games and family FaceTime calls during Covid. 

I used PTO for my current job to get time off to interview. They sent me the questions they would be asking that morning, and I spent all day preparing my answers and working through the scenarios. I felt confident. 

As soon as we started, my nerves hit. I stumbled over my words and lost track of sentences halfway through. I did my best to recover every time I stumbled, but I know it was obvious. All the great responses and tie-backs to my previous experience - forgotten. They asked, “What do you think qualifies you for this position and why should we hire you?” Me: “… I cook food good…” (not really but I might as well have said that). 

I guess I’m just looking for some encouragement to get through this next week while I’m waiting to hear back. I’m prepared for the ol’ “we’re going a different direction,” email.

"It's scary how fast the transition is from teenager to ""adult""","I put adult in quotes, because while its technically 18. Most people wouldn't call an 18 year old an adult. I'm talking more like early 20s.

I turn 21 in the next week, and its just crazy to think about. It doesn't really feel like i've reached this age. It just kinda feels bizarre. 3 years ago I was just graduating high school, then covid and college. And now i'm 21. It feels insanely fast.

And I know age is just a number. No one is saying you have to change or be a certain way just cause your 21 or 30 or 50 years old. But it's easy to see how society kinda stresses you out. Cause at this age, your starting to look for employment. People are kinda pass the immature teen stage. Start worrying way more about relationships. It feels harder to make friends. You put some pressure on yourself that you have to start being more of an ""adult"". Back in high school, I was kinda shy, worked on self improvement. But wasn't too worried, cause I was just a teenager. Now i feel like I have to get my shit together.

Ever Feel Like The Universe Is Rewarding You?,"Today I had a job interview. It was really difficult for me to build up the courage to FINALLY do an interview. I have severe social anxiety, selective mutism, and mild aphasia... and every time I've had a job interview, I've backed out. 

I had one today, which unfortunately ended very abruptly when the employer said that she was only hiring people who speak Spanish due to the large Spanish-speaking population that they serve. It was upsetting because the job listing didn't mention anything about that and it took me time and money (and a ton of effort) to show up to that interview. 

I was feeling really disappointed about the fact that the one time I actually finally found the courage to go to a job interview, I didn't even have a chance to do the whole interview. I spent so much time mentally and emotionally preparing for it. 

So, I was feeling a bit down about it, especially because I don't have money right now and paid for transportation to get to this interview and to go home for nothing, essentially. Later in the day, I was going for a walk and a $20 bill just came flying at me. It was the weirdest thing ever. But, I felt like it was a pat on the back from the Universe... like a 'Hey, you tried. Even though things didn't go as planned, you put in the effort and had every intention to get through that interview.'

Is it possible to love/prioritize your partner over your family?,"TL;DR - the title is self explanatory
Can you meet someone, fall in love with them, and then realise you would choose them over your family members (like parents or siblings)? On a  condition, that you have a healthy loving relationship with your family.

Okay, so now buckle up, I'll tell you the context

I love coming up with stories in my head and then draw art of it or make small writings etc.
And now I have this story but I'm not sure how realistic this one aspect of it is.

Basically, we have 2 people, let's call them Kei and May.

Kei grew up in a poor family; their mother and grandmother (whom they adored) passed away by the time they turned 13. Their father was a neglectful alcoholic, but not physically abusive.
They grew up on their own while also fully taking care of their 3 younger siblings.

May grew up materially well-off, but their blood family just didn't want to have anything do with them. So they were never needed by anyone; and people they loved always had someone else more important.

By the time the story starts both of the characters are in their late 20s, they fall in love and part of their dynamic is that Kei realises that May became their #1 priority. Now, here's a tricky part. 

Kei raised their siblings, part of the story is that at a certain point the siblings became the sole reason they carried on. Like, Kei lost themselves in this forced ""parenthood"" if yk what I mean?

And the siblings grew up fine; they are confident, self-sufficient and don't have major issues. Although it's clear they take Kei for granted at times.

It's easy to establish, that Kei *likes* May more, and prefers May's company. The two have a lot in common and suit each other perfectly. But is it really possible that this stranger becomes someone Kei cares even more about than their siblings?

What do you think? I've never been in love and I can't imagine choosing someone over my family so that's where I'm coming from

I took my son to see The Super Mario Bros. movie today and the excitement of the kids in the theater warmed my heart,"I took my ten year old to see the new Super Mario Bros. movie today and I was kinda in a sour mood from the start. The weather's been bad here these last few days and I've just been in a funk.

Paying with card at a restaurant is a very different experience in USA and Europe,"Just a very interesting cultural difference I've encountered when I first visited USA.

How it works in Europe: you ask your server for a bill and tell them you'll pay with your card. They bring a terminal to your table, you use your card/phone/watch to pay and then you leave. (This happened in USA only once in the entire 2 weeks of my stay). In some countries it's a nice gesture to leave 10% in cash if the service was great.

USA: I was so shocked that they actually take your card away from you (I would call the police if someone tried to do that in Poland, I think most people here would). But that's not all. I had an embarrassing moment the first time I was eating in a restaurant in USA. After they took my card and brought it back to my table, I filled the receipt with the ""tip"" and ""total"" amounts (of course I was aware that tipping in USA is a very different story than in Europe and I respected that everywhere), and... waited for someone to take my card again to complete the payment, because I thought they need to do that in order to take the tip! It took several minutes of me exchanging awkward looks with my server before I called them and they explained that I don't need to do anything more and I can just leave at this point.

I got used to that in the 2 weeks that I spent in the US, but it was still a weird feeling when I had to loose contact with my card!",Vatonee,11,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/12cy0si/paying_with_card_at_a_restaurant_is_a_very/,interesting cultural difference encountered first visited usa work europe ask server bill tell pay card bring terminal table use card phone watch pay leave happened usa entire 2 week stay country nice gesture leave 10 cash service wa great usa wa shocked actually take card away would call police someone tried poland think people would embarrassing moment first time wa eating restaurant usa took card brought back table filled receipt tip total amount course wa aware tipping usa different story europe respected everywhere waited someone take card complete payment thought need order take tip took several minute exchanging awkward look server called explained need anything leave point got used 2 week spent u wa still weird feeling loose contact card,paying card restaurant different experience usa europe,vat onee

I sat at the bar, next to a man in his 50s, and looked at my phone. The man introduced himself and asked how my day was going. Initially, I thought he was trying to hit on me. I was wrong. He was just a nice, friendly man who was interested in listening about my day. 

We talked while we ate our noodles, and he talked about his son, his job, and his life. It was a lovely conversation, and when we were done eating, we simply parted ways. We didn’t exchange contact info. We didn’t make plans to meet again. We just wished each other well. 

I still think about this man because he was a kind stranger who talked to me like he was a close friend. My own friends are married with kids, so I rarely hear from them now.

allergy wise im really allergic to mint (any kind of mint) so 90% toothpaste is not going to work for me. not unless i want my mouth really swollen. even if i go to buy the kids toothpaste almost all of it is mixed with mint. like strawberry mint. 
when i go to the dentist its bad too because they dont always keep track of whats mint. so lots of times i had to go home before they were done because my gums were swelling.

Critics actually did the Super Mario movie dirty.,"Movies and shows are made for specific audiences. I watched the new Super Mario movie last night, and it was a lot of fun. Going in, that was pretty much all I expected from the movie; it fulfilled that purpose pretty well.

However, it seems like the critics didn’t like it too much. This seemed to spark a whole conversation on whether or not critics are to be trusted. That ‘discourse’ turned toxic really quickly, turning into a bizarre culture war argument where the critic scores of Super Mario and Cuties were compared. I’m not really here to make that kind of point.

My point is that like a Transformers movie, it wasn’t made for critics… it was made for a general audience who want to turn their brain off and have some fun. It’s why the earlier Fast and Furious movies did really well despite mostly negative reviews. 

Basically, critics did Super Mario dirty, but that’s to be expected; it wasn’t made for them. I’d personally give it a 7.5 or an 8/10.

I get embarrassed when I tell my shoe size and height.,"I mean it’s the truth. I hate being asked how tall I am and what my shoe size them people get shocked on how big I am. One time I had my family over and one of my aunts friends was looking at my new shoes and was shocked at my shoe size. She said out loud, (my name) YOU WEAR A SIZE 14?! You wear a size 14 wide in women’s?! (My name) YOU HAVE BIG FEET!!” With a shocked and nasty look. Everyone just looked at me. I was embarrassed. My male cousins said,  “14?! Damn that’s HUGE! Especially for a woman! I’m a guy and I only wear a size 11 and I’m a guy! Quite frankly, that’s embarrassing, but she’s a tall, big girl what did you expect?
The girl’s friend said, “Damn girl! How do you even find shoes?! That is HUMONGOUS. No offense. I have tiny feet. At least we can find shoes. 
My aunt was just looking at and didn’t say anything. She gave me that “Well it’s true” look. 
The girl said, “(My name) not a lot of women have that shoe size, plus you’re tall so it’s perfectly proportional for your size. I wear a size 8-9 and I’m 5’3 and people thought it was big for my size.”
None of my family said anything to her shouting how big my feet are.
That’s why when someone asked about my shoe size, I don’t wanna say but them one of my family just shouts it out and say I always take too long to answer.

Hi! I'm Moonie and I just saved a bunch of snails :3,"As the title says! I was just tip-toeing around this curious path which was essentially a little snail family just chillin' in there. It was just raining and when that happens this little path tends to get full of these cuties.

Now, the thing about this little path is that people like to use it... a lot. So this makes the little path look more like a snail graveyard instead of a wholesome snail convention where little snails gather to buy exclusive snail items.

I had no rush, as I was chillin' too. So I decided to help out this little slimy friends. As I was taking each of them personally to the other side of the road so that they wouldn't be stepped on, I managed to retrieve some important information I am gonna share with you guys now.

You see, because the snails have been stepped on so many times before, and no kind souls had offered their help untill now, the snails thought it was a good idea to take over the world and destroy humanity.

Now I'm just doing my part as a citizen of the world to let you guys know about your imminent ruination.
Snails don't take being mass murdered everytime it rains kindly.

I tried reasoning with them. I told them hey not everyone is bad. Some people are just so distracted they don't even see you guys down there!

Of course, this helped a little bit as the snails calmed down. They thanked me for helping them out, they said they will return the favour by not taking over the world. 

As for today, you my beautiful friends won't have to worry about the snail threat anymore. U can sleep peacefully knowing u r safe. No need to thank me. just do me a favour. Try not to step on the little guy. aye?

Just a full moon feelings,"Oh yes! My woter just broke. I'm having a child that I wanted so much. He was perfect... Touching him, holding him and the smell of him... I instantly fell in love.

They told me there were some complications at the birth, his brain didn't have enough oxigen, but I thought it woud develop or compansate at one point.
He wasn't developed as others, but for me, he was still perfect.

Months, years have passed and he wasn't able to speak or walk.

I was pregnant again. I had a girl. Lovely, gentle little creature I could also give all my love to.
After five years, she asked me: Could you give me a sibling I could talk too?

I felt blame, I felt, at the first time of my life, that I could not help the first child as long as I was hoping. I can just love him unconditionally, as I did. 
But yes, I had another child. 

Fear of me gone and him staying by himself was so overwhelming, I felt I had no choice. 
There's nothing more precious than children and the love for them. 

My oldest is now 20. We still all live together. 
The other two are a team, the oldest one is just here for love. 

I admit, sometimes I'm so tired, sometimes it bothers me why I'm living such a life, but when I sit with him and silently look into his eyes, I know exactly why he's here, here but not here.

Would it be impractical to buy a flip phone in today’s world?,"I’m 22F and social media is taking over my mental health. Just having an account in general isn’t bad (especially since it’s a good way of keeping in touch with family and friends) but having 24/7 access to it in my pocket wherever I go has made me obsessed with it and feel like a zombie that’s always looking at my screen. My first instinct whenever I’m bored is to pull up tik tok or Instagram or Twitter or Snapchat, any of those. It’s like my fingers have a mind of their own and do it without my brain processing it. Same thing with mobile games and other apps, I feel like I’m just always on my phone. 

I’ve been kicking around the idea of paying this phone off and then switching mainly over to a flip phone that will allow me to call and text and that’s it. I know I can just delete the apps and try to have self control, but part of me wants to quit cold turkey and change my lifestyle. I feel like my attention span has plummeted and I’m losing productivity due to always wanting to be on my phone. But is it practical in todays society? For example for multiple job interviews they texted me a link to a website rather than emailing it, so I don’t know how that would be accomplished on a phone that’s not a smart phone with easy-to-navigate internet browser (I know some flip phones have internet on it, but still). Also with some restaurants making you scan a QR code to access their menu, and then traveling is so much easier with a mobile passport.

Anyways, I just wanted some opinions on this and rather or not I’m being realistic about this.",Sea-Farmer4654,57,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/12cpdti/would_it_be_impractical_to_buy_a_flip_phone_in/,22f social medium taking mental health account general bad especially since good way keeping touch family friend 24 7 access pocket wherever go ha made obsessed feel like zombie always looking screen first instinct whenever bored pull tik tok instagram twitter snapchat like finger mind without brain processing thing mobile game apps feel like always phone kicking around idea paying phone switching mainly flip phone allow call text know delete apps try self control part want quit cold turkey change lifestyle feel like attention span ha plummeted losing productivity due always wanting phone practical today society example multiple job interview texted link website rather emailing know would accomplished phone smart phone easy navigate internet browser know flip phone internet still also restaurant making scan qr code access menu traveling much easier mobile passport anyways wanted opinion rather realistic,would impractical buy flip phone today world,sea farmer 4654

My 2 year old daughter made me so proud today,"She always does tho, she’s amazing.

Now, for the last 35 years, ever since I was born, my 1 constant in life is Super Mario. I’ve played practically every game, when a new game comes out, I play it. The oldest stuff I have from my childhood is Mario related.

Well, this morning I was watching her, we played with her toys some before daycare and then she wanted to watch tv. I put on the firestick, and she kept yelling what I thought was “Bananas” but close to “Mynana”. So I put on Bananas in Pajamas. She got upset. I picked her up, took her to the TV, and she pointed to the Super Mario Bros Supershow. “Mynana” was actually “Mario”. We have never let her watch that before. I had no idea she knew who Mario was.

So i put it on, she started dancing to the Mario Bros Supershow rap at the beginning, when the show came on she sat there laughing and giggling and asking question. She called Toad “Baby”, Luigi is “Weegee” and Princess Toadstool/Peach is “Let it go” after Frozen.

On the drive to daycare, which is like 5 mins, she just wanted to listen to Mario. So I put the themesong to the show on and played it through my car speakers. She’s giggling and loving it.

I think this week I’m gonna bust out my Super Mario comic from Nintendo Power and read a few to her.

friendgroup ignoring me and my friend,"
So we are a friendgroup of 5 and have been very close for the past 6 months. Eat lunch together everyday (we are in high school) spend every free moment together, text all the time, hangout all the time, we are an established tightknit friend group. 

But me and another girl in the friend group have become way closer with each other than the rest of the group. The rest of the group is very hyperfocused on boys, parties, gossip, classic high school things. And me and this other girl are, i think, more school oriented while the others are completely uninterested in school. We go to a very competitive highly regarded acedemics focused school so the norm here is to be school oriented. So in this friend group we are not really well percieved and are kind of known as slackers.

And just the values with me and this girl are completely different from the other three, we are always the ones who don't smoke, when we go shopping with them they shoplift we dont, we dont drink regularly like them. So in general I think after so much time with them we both kind of checked out emotionally after being tired of the same surface level talks with them everyday, boys and talking bad about people, thats it. And I'm sure thats not their only interests and I am not trying to act like I am so much better than them because like a lot of people I also enjoy gossip and boy talk but thats all we talk about and I think we both just got tired of it.

Today me and this girl decided to seperate from the group for this one lunch to study for a big upcoming test, our logic was that everytime we try to study WITH them they dont really study and it just becomes another gossip session. And usually it would be okay but this is a really important test. We thought it wouldnt be a big deal. as soon as the bell rang we went up to a classroom and studied the entire lunch. At the end of the day when we spotted the group outside the school and as we walked up to them they looked at us and then turned and they all walked away. We texted them asking if they are mad and have gotten no response, it has been 5 hours and they are all always on their phone.

What should we do? We know its going to be drama with them and we don't want that. We are considering just letting this friendgroup go since they seem to be letting us go.",heartsmilexx,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/12d3mop/friendgroup_ignoring_me_and_my_friend/,friendgroup 5 close past 6 month eat lunch together everyday high school spend every free moment together text time hangout time established tightknit friend group another girl friend group become way closer rest group rest group hyperfocused boy party gossip classic high school thing girl think school oriented others completely uninterested school go competitive highly regarded acedemics focused school norm school oriented friend group really well percieved kind known slacker value girl completely different three always one smoke go shopping shoplift dont dont drink regularly like general think much time kind checked emotionally tired surface level talk everyday boy talking bad people thats sure thats interest trying act like much better like lot people also enjoy gossip boy talk thats talk think got tired today girl decided seperate group one lunch study big upcoming test logic wa everytime try study dont really study becomes another gossip session usually would okay really important test thought wouldnt big deal soon bell rang went classroom studied entire lunch end day spotted group outside school walked looked u turned walked away texted asking mad gotten response ha 5 hour always phone know going drama want considering letting friendgroup go since seem letting u go,friendgroup ignoring friend,heart smile xx

My idea of fitness that I would like to perhaps someday achieve a nice balance of:,"Is it called anything when you attempt to take a holistic approach to fitness?

So I guess for me if I had to define ‘holistic’ in this exact context I’d make this list:

-Stretching and Yogic type holds, or activities like planks and wall sits 

-balance and ‘hippie’ related stuff like walking on pipes and slack lines 

-Calisthenics and body weight type exercises 

-high reps of low weight and low reps of higher weight 

-“full range” or “functional strength” kettlebell stuff, might be bro science idk 🤷‍♂️ but I like the idea 

-acrobatics and learning to jump and flip and spin and kick and such 

-Walk &gt; Jog &gt; Run, sprints and endurance 

-Hiking

-Swimming and body therapy in water

-Recreational movement, anything you do for fun, could be anything that pops into your head when ya hear that… or it could be like ultimate frisbee or a sport or skateboarding, snowboarding, long boarding, dancing, white water rafting, etc.

-required movement, like shoveling snow or cleaning house 

-perhaps take up grappling/BJJ or some other type of martial art, or even MMA

-maybe Wim Hof style polar plunges and breathing techniques 


to be able to achieve a solid balance of all of these activities would somehow be really righteous!

Today she showed up at our door with a bag, it had: A dress, a sketchbook, markers, and a card! How sweet is that seriously!! I thanked her like wayyyyy too many times and I promised I'd give her a drawing when she got back from her trip! 

She's done tons of really kind things for me, especially because she knows how my family is, one time I was outside hanging out with her son and I got really overwhelmed and upset because I started having some sensory overload.. She walked over to me and crouched down and comforted me until I felt better! Oh and she also cuts my hair too, which is really nice, cause I have a thing were loose hair makes me extremely anxious and she said she knew how to cut hair and avoid that problem because her son ALSO hates haircuts for similar reasons.

A friend of mine asked me if I ever thought about modelling,"As the title says, we hung out last weekend in our friend group and when we were chatting my friend, lets call her Liz, asked me if I ever thought about modelling.

It kind of caught me off guard as I'm not used to being flattered like this and I just said something along the lines of ""No, not really why would I"" and brushed it off, because I didn't know how to react to such a compliment. She then talked about how good I looked in my instagram posts and how the pony tail I wore that evening really suited me. Me being socially inept then proceeded to talk about how this really is not the case and how she's wrong in her assessment. (Honestly I felt like ""too humbled"" to just accept the compliment because I don't want to be put on a pedestal like this)

But honestly I keep thinking about it, I do consider myself attractive, but nowhere near being a model. Being basically called that by a girl is like a huge deal to me, especially since I've been working on my style and looks and having it recognized in such a way feels good asf.

I'm getting hired on full time at my job!,"Obligatory mobile user warning. So, after many years in child care, I abruptly exited the field. My boss and I got into a heated argument and she ""suspended"" me without giving me a time frame. So I told her to shove the job where the sun don't shine. I spent the next day crying and applying for jobs online. Then my best friend, being the Goddess that she is, told me to try a temp agency. I know everyone has different experiences with these agencies but I said screw it. What did I have to lose right? By the following week, I had an interview with a heavy equipment company. The guys seemed really nice but I didnt know anything about construction equipment. I left the interview thinking I wasn't getting the job. Well, I guess I charmed them, because they called the agency and said they wanted to give me a shot. So, I've been here learning as much as possible. I always sat on the edge of my seat wondering if I would get hired or not. My contract was for 3 months and  2 months and 2 weeks in, I still hadnt heard a word from them about what was going to happen. Last week, my boss asked how long my contract was because he forgot. Well, my 3 months mark comes up this week, and my boss just told me that he'd like to hire me!!

“Yolo”-ing has changed my life,"I’m 18(f) and started doing this thing called “yolo”-ing. I realized I have a couple of months before I graduate high school, so anything I do that’s “embarrassing” is something I only have to deal with for a couple more months.

—

So things that once would’ve sent me in an overtthinking spiral, I would mentally tell myself “it’s a yolo” and it makes me feel better.

I do things because they’ll make me happy. And not restrict myself because I’m worried that it will be embarrassing. 

My bf, who is wonderful in every way, has also been encouraging this. If I find myself worried about something, he’ll remind me that we’re yolo-ing in 2023. He’s just absolutely amazing 

—

As long as I’m not hurting other people, I yolo as much as I want because I’m not having to deal with the opinions of my peers for much longer 

However, “yolo-ing” began to bloom into something more. I feel an esteem and general happiness boost. I stopped overthinking about the people who don’t seem to like me. I find myself ending the school day more bubbly than I used to. 

I got diagnosed with social anxiety disorder and ocd *this* year, but they’ve always been a significant part of my teenage years. 

This new “yolo”-ing has made me feel like I’m winning against my mental health. Do I still feel anxious on days? Yes. Does my OCD effect my everyday? Yes. But has it become a lot less significant 

I never realized it but my social anxiety feels like I’ve been hiding under a blanket for years. While it’s not completely gone, I feel much less constricted by it. Like my head it peaking out of the blanket 

—

I’ve only been yolo-ing for a couple weeks, but it’s truly made my life a lot more relaxing yet fun :)

Where should we move? Please help! Tell me about where you live if you love it!,"Hi!

We're originally both from the Midwest, but have been living in the Bay Area (CA) for about 10 years. We now have a 1 year old, and for various reasons, are considering a move. We work from home, and cost of living thankfully won't be a deciding factor for us (most places, even cities, seem affordable compared to here).

Things we like/we're hoping for (not necessarily all of these):

\-We would love to be within driving distance of family in Michigan. By this I mean 10-12 hours or less ideally (so we could do it in a day or overnight), but honestly anything less than 15 would be a huge plus! Would consider a bit farther for the right place. We want our baby to see her grandparents and cousins more often!

\-I'm a writer and husband loves music, so somewhere with a decent arts community or working artists would be a plus. Can be music, visual arts, whatever. We're open to smaller cities/towns, but would ideally like a vibrant community.

\-A town/city or neighborhood of a city with other families with young kids. We'd love to meet new friends wherever we end up, and it would be nice to find some people in similar life stages.

\-We both love warm to hot weather and sunshine, but we're definitely open to snowy winters again for the right place. Would prefer more sunshine than Michigan though. This is one reason we don't want to live in MI. The lake effect and lack of winter sun does a number on us.

\-Cities are a plus, but we're definitely open to smaller communities that are within a couple hours from major metro areas, especially if there's public transit.

\-We were both raised in swing states and are somewhat open to a red state, but only if it's a liberal area/city/bubble.

\-Walkable downtown area is a plus, with at least a handful of good or decent restaurants.

\-Good public elementary schools, or at least upwardly trending if the place is changing.

\-Friendly, welcoming people would be a huge plus. We miss people saying hello on walks, etc.

\-We love the outdoors. Access to parks, green spaces, hiking a plus. Huge bonus if there are rivers, mountains, waterfalls, anything like that.

\-Beaches are a huge plus. We all love swimming.

If your home has some or most of these things, please tell me about it and why you love it!

Cute guy I’ve barely talked to told me he would’ve brought me a gift if he knew it was my bday,"We’ve seen each other a few times now on a weekly frequency as we’re in the same organization. We talked the very first day because we happened to walk in at the same exact time, just us two! We rarely had a chance to talk until recently when he heard me talking to a friend about my birthday and intentionally initiated a conversation with me. We were flirty during the whole chat and he said he would’ve brought me a gift if he knew my bday was recent. That was really sweet and made me feel for the first time that maybe he was interested? I’m interested in him without a doubt. But a part of me was also like is he love bombing, since we barely know each other. He seems the shy sensitive type so could it be he was just being friendly? I can’t stop thinking about him and how of all the topics in the world he paid special attention to my bday, because the opposite is exactly why I walked away from my narcissist ex who ignored my bday. Should I ask him what he would’ve gotten me? I feel like that’d be cute. Is he lovebombing or seem genuine, or can’t tell? Any other advice? There’s only 1 more event where we’ll get to see each other as of now!

Edit: Thank you so much for all the advice and support! I’m genuinely attracted to him and don’t want to lose the possibility of building further, but I’m anxious/overwhelmed by many other commitments on my plate that I’m handling all at once. I get so swept up in romance; it becomes harder to focus. Then again, if not now then when right? He’s a rare one. And work is always going to be there. We’re also at the age when folks are settling down and I’m not getting any younger. The darker issue is I’m afraid of being vulnerable yet again and potential excruciating pain if it doesn’t work out. I don’t know if it’s just that I haven’t been with the right person, or if I need to adjust internally. I don’t want to be the alone sad girl time and time again 🥹 I’ve heard of really slow-paced relationships working out though so perhaps I should trust the process and just express the need for a slower pace?",thecuriousberry,63,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/12b37sh/cute_guy_ive_barely_talked_to_told_me_he_wouldve/,seen time weekly frequency organization talked first day happened walk exact time u two rarely chance talk recently heard talking friend birthday intentionally initiated conversation flirty whole chat said would brought gift knew bday wa recent wa really sweet made feel first time maybe wa interested interested without doubt part wa also like love bombing since barely know seems shy sensitive type could wa friendly stop thinking topic world paid special attention bday opposite exactly walked away narcissist ex ignored bday ask would gotten feel like cute lovebombing seem genuine tell advice 1 event get see edit thank much advice support genuinely attracted want lose possibility building anxious overwhelmed many commitment plate handling get swept romance becomes harder focus right rare one work always going also age folk settling getting younger darker issue afraid vulnerable yet potential excruciating pain work know right person need adjust internally want alone sad girl time time heard really slow paced relationship working though perhaps trust process express need slower pace,cute guy barely talked told would brought gift knew wa bday,curious berry

"I got ""checked out"" today and I'm just happy."," 

I'm a 35 yo male have a normal house to work and kids routine and I don't normally interact with clients all that much but today I had to and when I opened the door the woman in front of me literally did a sweeping upward motion with her eyes and just kind of stared at me for a few seconds after I greeted her. It seemed like she wanted to say something but nothing was coming out until I asked ""What can I help you with?"" and we continued with the conversation. In the end I just ended up taking a message for a coworker, writing down her phone number on a sticky note and putting it on some papers she was dropping off but she seemed happy reciting her name and number.

Now I know this is subtle and could simply be misunderstood but I had a distinct feeling she checked me out because of the way she behaved, I used to get it all the time when I was younger  and know how to tell the difference. I just haven't been checked out like this in a while but it might be that I'm filling out nicely since I've been working out lately and recently got a much needed haircut.

In any case I feel happy.

Which room in your house could you survive in for a week?,"So if you had to be locked in one room of your house for a week, which room would you prefer it to be? 1 million dollars is on the line.

The rules:

* You can only bring 1 item from another room with you into the room you chose. If you have something in your pocket, that thing would be your 1 item, so you'd have to take it out if you didn't want it with you and choose a different item.
* You cannot take anything out of the room you chose that was already in there.
* Once you step into the room you chose, you'll be locked in and the week will begin. This rule is just to encourage you to choose your 1 item carefully.
* If there is a window in the room you chose, you can open it, but you cannot stick any part of your body out. Same goes for a door, you can open it, but you cannot stick any part of your body out.

Personally, I would choose my living room. I would be able to watch TV, sleep on the couch, sit at my desk to work, and use the treadmill / bike machine. My 1 item from another room would be a bag of dried mango slices; they are my go-to snack, so as long as I can stop myself from eating the entire bag in one day, I'll be okay.

The only issue is the bathroom situation. I have a balcony attached to the living room, so I could certainly open the sliding glass door and do my business if I have to go number one.

Enough about me, though.

"Shared Apartment Laundry Etiquette...a tale of 5 washers, 4 dryers, and 88 units","didn't really know where else to post this but i feel like talking! i live in an apartment building with 88 units ranging from studios to 2brs. There is laundry in-building: 5 average household sized washing machines, two average household sized dryers, and two slightly larger more commercial sized dryers. running one machine costs $2, so an average load of laundry is $4 if you use one washer and one dryer.

i have enough sets of linens &amp; clothes that I do laundry maybe every 2-3 weeks or so. i usually fill up 2 washing machines, and one larger dryer.

i just went down to do my laundry and saw that one guy was currently using all 5 washing machines and all 4 dryers. :( so i went all the way down with my dirty laundry just to bring it all the way back up. 

i guess my question is, what is the proper etiquette for shared laundry in a building? i guess he's not doing anything wrong by using the washers available, but it seems rude to me to take up all five of them when there really aren't that many for such a large building. what do you guys think?",ratatouillethot,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/12buozy/shared_apartment_laundry_etiquettea_tale_of_5/,really know else post feel like talking live apartment building 88 unit ranging studio 2brs laundry building 5 average household sized washing machine two average household sized dryer two slightly larger commercial sized dryer running one machine cost 2 average load laundry 4 use one washer one dryer enough set linen amp clothes laundry maybe every 2 3 week usually fill 2 washing machine one larger dryer went laundry saw one guy wa currently using 5 washing machine 4 dryer went way dirty laundry bring way back guess question proper etiquette shared laundry building guess anything wrong using washer available seems rude take five really many large building guy think,shared apartment laundry etiquette tale 5 washer 4 dryer 88 unit,ratatouille thot
Anyone else remember dumb advice that was hammered into you growing up?,"(I’m a millennial for reference)

Specifically I remember my parents proclaiming how 1BR homes/condos have terrible resale value and to avoid getting on rental leases when possible.

Like 1BR places most everywhere have great resale value, especially these days where any property is a great investment and barely affordable for our generation. And it’s really difficult, and not to mention shady, to not be put on the lease if you’re moving into an apartment with someone. 

When I moved into my first apartment with 2 of my friends right out of college they tried to tell me not to get on the lease, and I was like, that’s just not possible…

"Just watched Sinister, apparently one of the scariest horror movies","I've always been absolutely terrified of watching or reading horror because I'm an anxious person, always have been. Even goofy horror movies like The Haunted Mansion (2003) gave me nightmares, and I struggled to watch The Ring with my friends as a teenager. Couldn't get through the Goosebumps series. I watched The Evil Dead remake when I was 16 and actually screamed throughout it. 

But over the past year, I've been desensitizing myself with horror movies like Paranormal Activity, Cabin in the Woods, The Shining, Nope, then building up the intensity with things like House of 1000 Corpses, The Exorcist, Hereditary, and the podcast The Magnus Archives (I listened to 3 episodes, and couldn't continue it until a year later, and by that point I somehow found it calming??). Stories that involve home invasion are the scariest to me since I start hearing all the noises in my house even more than I usually do! 

Sinister had 3-4 major jumpscares, but it wasn't that bad, probably because I was expecting them. I think horror might start to be a genre I really enjoy because the stories are often a metaphor for some deep/dark parts of reality. Though it's a full moon tonight which is making things seem a little spooky so I would appreciate the distraction of you telling me the movies you were afraid to watch, or times you worked to overcome your anxiety :)",ojutdohi,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/12bzh68/just_watched_sinister_apparently_one_of_the/,always absolutely terrified watching reading horror anxious person always even goofy horror movie like haunted mansion 2003 gave nightmare struggled watch ring friend teenager get goosebump series watched evil dead remake wa 16 actually screamed throughout past year desensitizing horror movie like paranormal activity cabin wood shining nope building intensity thing like house 1000 corps exorcist hereditary podcast magnus archive listened 3 episode continue year later point somehow found calming story involve home invasion scariest since start hearing noise house even usually sinister 3 4 major jumpscares bad probably wa expecting think horror might start genre really enjoy story often metaphor deep dark part reality though full moon tonight making thing seem little spooky would appreciate distraction telling movie afraid watch time worked overcome anxiety,watched sinister apparently one scariest horror movie,jut hi

Feeling left out from a group and self isolation,"I found a group of friends that I really liked hanging out with but ended up arguing pretty badly with one of them. Now being around this person gives me anxiety and I generally want to stay away from them because of their morals so I'm missing out on a lot of hang outs and I'm generally falling out of the group.  
Today the group started playing a game that we all wanted to play together (but never really decided on a day). None of them asked me if I wanted to join, and since that person is there I'm uncomfortable joining on my own. I keep missing the occasions when they're meeting and I'm slowly falling out; when I do get the occasion to hang out with them I feel like a stranger both because they talk about stuff that I missed, and also because I myself feel like I don't belong in there anymore. This feeds into my fears of ""being abandoned and replaced"" so I suddenly feel the urge to entertain them as best as I can on those rare occasions we do hang out.  


I should probably talk about this with at least one of them, but then I'd feel like this would just end up like a ""pick me"" situation where I force them to hang out with me even if they don't want to or would rather hang out with this person which just feels selfish and wrong",3veryUsername1s7aken,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/12bjzam/feeling_left_out_from_a_group_and_self_isolation/,found group friend really liked hanging ended arguing pretty badly one around person give anxiety generally want stay away moral missing lot hang generally falling group today group started playing game wanted play together never really decided day none asked wanted join since person uncomfortable joining keep missing occasion meeting slowly falling get occasion hang feel like stranger talk stuff missed also feel like belong anymore feed fear abandoned replaced suddenly feel urge entertain best rare occasion hang probably talk least one feel like would end like pick situation force hang even want would rather hang person feel selfish wrong,feeling left group self isolation,3 username 1 7 ken

How do you deal with being torn between two identities?,"Currently in college in USA.

My family is half Polish (all on my mom’s side). My dad’s side of the family has similar ancestry, but has been in America longer. I went to Poland very frequently growing up, and have put in the time to learn in a lot of the language, although I can’t call myself fluent yet, but I hope to be within the next year.

I recently met someone else in college (we’ll call them Cary) who was fully born in Poland and transferred to America for college. We have had great conversation, but I met Cary after reaching out through other people. I was so excited to meet someone with this culture in common.

When we met in person, Cary seemed disappointed I was born in the US and had an American accent. When a mutual acquaintance talked to them alone and mentioned me, Cary went out of their way to clarify that I was only “half-polish”.

I don’t know. It just hurts. I’ve never claimed to be completely one thing or the other, and it’s always something I thought I could find cool about myself.

Nice people exist,"I(28F) am a software developer for 4 years. Its highly male dominated field(atleast according to my experience). I’m the only female developer in my current company, and same was the case in my past 2 companies, except having 2 juniors in one of the past companies.

I’m highly introverted, and not conventionally good looking. I have least knowledge about makeup, and mess up with blending every single time. I come from poor background, and realised soon that development is pretty laid back kinda job and has potential to get you decent lifestyle. Anyways, my past experiences with managers have never been very good. Since I don’t speak a lot, and probably give under-confident vibe, managers automatically assume that I’m dumb and always need a male guidance. I’m not super smart either. I consider myself average, but I’m a major observant, and surprisingly, most of my peers are also average.

This new company also has one such manager who dislikes me. I don’t know why. I even have been courageous to ask him directly about it, but he would deny it downright, and tell me that I’m being hysterical. He would treat me, and my guy teammate totally opposite. It just breaks my heart. He avoids all suggestions made by me, but would entertain my guy team member if he gave the same solution to a problem.

I have left my past companies within less than 2 years due to the environment. But I have been year for about 3 years. The reason is the CEO of the company. When I left my past company, my mental health was at its lowest. I used to beat myself up for every single thing (still do but in less intensity). Furthermore, my family wasn’t doing too good personally and financially. I also got diagnosed with RA at that time. I met my current CEO during that time. They took this entrance exam, which I performed bad at, as I was not ready. But I discussed the entire paper, along with my solutions with him, and he was just so thrilled by me. I don’t know how I managed to charm him then. He used to be a model, so he has great physique, is conventionally super attractive and a brilliant person. He became my favourite person really soon. He would support me, listen to my ideas, provide feedback, and have genuine interest in discussions. He provides me credit where it is due, which almost never happened in my 5 years of experience. All this when we’ve never met personally. He is in foreign country. 

I have been doing really great at work. Occasionally, feel bad about my manager. But he’s also good friend of CEO, so complaining about him brings little result, except that Ive gotten chance to work with the CEO directly, rather than having to deal with the manager. I work extended hours without any pressure.

When's the last time you tried a new recipe?,"I'm not very adventurous in the kitchen. Cooking is a chore, and I want to get it over with. I usually just go for lentil soup, because it's easy, tasty, and I already have it memorized. But I felt bad about always serving my friend the same thing when they visit, so I decided to try something new.

Ended up finding a simple recipe for refried beans. Added in some onion, cumin, black olives, and cheddar. Serve it with some fried eggs and chives. It was really good, and it was the first time my macro app ever reported that I actually hit my protein target for the day. It's a bit annoying, since I only have one skillet, so I have to make the beans, wash it, then make the eggs. I'd better get a second one!

Just heard the WEIRDEST and CREEPIEST sound outside and idk what it is.,"It's currently 11pm for me. I'm a smoker but I typically don't go outside past like 9. I have raccoons that come on my patio and coyotes and such that linger around my creek that's about 20 feet from my apt. I'm also just afraid of what goes bump in the night. I live in the mountains, in the Appalachians. I very much believe in legends and things, beings, we don't understand or have proof of. 

I just finished up working on an assignment, and decided to risk it for the biscuit. I just stood outside my door and didn't go on my patio so I had light and a quick escape incase a raccoon appeared. 

I'm standing there and I notice there's a weird, constant noise in the distance. I've never heard anything like it. Not quite sure how to explain it but it sounded like a uniform, collective, highpitch humming/vocalization? 

It wasn't steady, the pitch and volume would rise and lower. It was constant though with no breaks. I smoke a cigarette in maybe 8ish minutes and it was happening the entire time. It didn't sound human at all, and it sounded like hundreds of something contributing to it. 

It sounded like something straight out of a horror movie. One of the songs they'd play towards the end of the movie as the main character is exploring, or discovering something. Right before the big bad whatever happens. 

I'm not saying this noise was necessarily anything of the paranormal/other worldly nature but I don't know what the fuck. My guess is maybe somehow a collection of bugs or whatever matched eachother in just the right way to make whatever that was. 

It was kind of centralized, too. It was in an area behind the building next to mine. My building is like this __  that building is like this / next to me. So __ /. It was coming from behind it, kind of near a bridge and the creek over there. It was also pretty loud, like no doubts I was actually hearing that. 

I don't know. I don't think I'll be going outside again past 9 lol not a clue what it was, but I want nothing to do with it. If anyone has any ideas, let me know.",Ox-Moi,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/12b81f9/just_heard_the_weirdest_and_creepiest_sound/,currently 11pm smoker typically go outside past like 9 raccoon come patio coyote linger around creek 20 foot apt also afraid go bump night live mountain appalachian much believe legend thing understand proof finished working assignment decided risk biscuit stood outside door go patio light quick escape incase raccoon appeared standing notice weird constant noise distance never heard anything like quite sure explain sounded like uniform collective highpitch humming vocalization steady pitch volume would rise lower wa constant though break smoke cigarette maybe 8ish minute wa happening entire time sound human sounded like hundred something contributing sounded like something straight horror movie one song play towards end movie main character exploring discovering something right big bad whatever happens saying noise wa necessarily anything paranormal worldly nature know fuck guess maybe somehow collection bug whatever matched eachother right way make whatever wa wa kind centralized wa area behind building next mine building like __ building like next __ wa coming behind kind near bridge creek wa also pretty loud like doubt wa actually hearing know think going outside past 9 lol clue wa want nothing anyone ha idea let know,heard weirdest creepiest sound outside idk,ox moi

That time my house was put under siege by a bunch of kids.,"So when I was 13, two of my friends came to my house looking visibly scared. I asked them if they wanted to go play outside but they said that they prefered staying inside my house playing videogames and that they didn't want to go outside no matter what .

I noticed something was clearly wrong with them and asked them what had happened.

They said that they had just fought with a bunch of other kids (who were a year older than us) and that they managed to run away and had come to my house to hide.

A few minutes passed and my house's telephone rang while we were playing Super Smash Bros Brawl. I recognized the caller as one of the older kids my friends were fleeing from. He asked me if my friends were with me and I told him that they had stopped by a short while ago but that I had denied them entry to my house because I had homework to do. (Obviously this was a lie, both of them were inside the house playing videogames). By the way, my parents had gone shopping so we were home alone. 

So anyways, more time passed and two other friends  came to my house. I welcomed them in, but they insisted we should get out of the house and play outside. The other two friends who had first came to the house explained them the situation but they insisted we had to get out. 

Until finally they spilled the beans and told us that they had been forced by the older kids to lure us all out of the house and had threatened to beat us all up (themselves included) if they refused. The older kids had surrounded my house and were hiding behind some nearby bushes, waiting for us to fall for their trap. 

So to recap: there's the two friends who had fought with the older kids and had come to my house to hide from them, there's the other two friends who the older kids tried to turn against us but ultimately decided to stick with us and then there's me, who unwillingly got caught up in all of this and all 5 of us were being besieged inside my house by the gang of older kids who were waiting outside to beat us all up.

The siege continued as did the Smash Bros matches for neary two hours until one of my friends got a call from his dad who told him he had to go cut his hair. My friend explained to his dad where he was and what was going on, and finally, a few minutes afterwards, the older kids surrounding my house all ran away when my friend's dad rode to my house on his van and yelled at them. 

The 5 of us exited the house in cheers and the older kids never threatened us again. And so...one of the craziest and most memorable annecdotes from my childhood came to an end. I didn't speak a word of this to my parents when they returned home.",JAR_2004,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/12asf2p/that_time_my_house_was_put_under_siege_by_a_bunch/,wa 13 two friend came house looking visibly scared asked wanted go play outside said prefered staying inside house playing videogames want go outside matter noticed something wa clearly wrong asked happened said fought bunch kid year older u managed run away come house hide minute passed house telephone rang playing super smash bros brawl recognized caller one older kid friend fleeing asked friend told stopped short ago denied entry house homework obviously wa lie inside house playing videogames way parent gone shopping home alone anyways time passed two friend came house welcomed insisted get house play outside two friend first came house explained situation insisted get finally spilled bean told u forced older kid lure u house threatened beat u included refused older kid surrounded house hiding behind nearby bush waiting u fall trap recap two friend fought older kid come house hide two friend older kid tried turn u ultimately decided stick u unwillingly got caught 5 u besieged inside house gang older kid waiting outside beat u siege continued smash bros match neary two hour one friend got call dad told go cut hair friend explained dad wa wa going finally minute afterwards older kid surrounding house ran away friend dad rode house van yelled 5 u exited house cheer older kid never threatened u one craziest memorable annecdotes childhood came end speak word parent returned home,time house wa put siege bunch kid,jar 2004
Modern art does not deserve the hate.,"There's this new trend where people are showing van gogh's paintings and comparing them to the new modern abstract art. They basically say ""how did we go from this to this"". As someone who has 0 interest in art, I still think it's more than just what you see on the surface level. It's not even supposed to be visually pleasing, it's a form of expression and expression can be ugly, sad, beautiful and horrifying. Sure you can have an opinion on it, but I feel like alot of people are just saying they don't like modern art because they simply don't care to understand it.
Another argument I've seen people say is that abstract art is low effort. I don't think so, but again I'm not very knowledgeable about it. What do you guys think?",slow_yellow1877,48,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/12amd83/modern_art_does_not_deserve_the_hate/,new trend people showing van gogh painting comparing new modern abstract art basically say go someone ha 0 interest art still think see surface level even supposed visually pleasing form expression expression ugly sad beautiful horrifying sure opinion feel like alot people saying like modern art simply care understand another argument seen people say abstract art low effort think knowledgeable guy think,modern art doe deserve hate,slow yellow 1877
"By the end of this week, I will have €1k for the first time ever at 21!","In the past 4 years, I have struggled to keep a job. Between covid happening, poor work conditions or my mental health making me struggle to not have dark thoughts, I'm finally in track to gaining my first 1k euros ever!

All of my jobs have unfortunately underpaid me below minimum wage, and most have overworked me beyond whatever wage they offered me, which often lead to me just quitting on the spot

I would say I'm good with money, but having ti pay for my own expenses through long gaps of unemployment meant I couldn't keep most of it..

However, a few weeks ago I got an apprenticeship for a small painting company in my area! Although the pay isn't the best, it's better than what I would have gotten in my last 3 jobs, and there's potential for a pay increase in the future!

So thanks to this job, I will finally be able to get my first €1k! which i will probably save up for a personal holiday by myself or something along that line",Untakenusr,5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/12ahvw3/by_the_end_of_this_week_i_will_have_1k_for_the/,past 4 year struggled keep job covid happening poor work condition mental health making struggle dark thought finally track gaining first 1k euro ever job unfortunately underpaid minimum wage overworked beyond whatever wage offered often lead quitting spot would say good money ti pay expense long gap unemployment meant keep however week ago got apprenticeship small painting company area although pay best better would gotten last 3 job potential pay increase future thanks job finally able get first 1k probably save personal holiday something along line,end week 1k first time ever 21,un taken u r

Hard time remembering childhood?,"Hi all!

I was a middle child growing up. Born in the early 90s. My older sibling was 10 years older than myself. In the late 90s/early 2000s my family and older sibling recorded most of stuff we did. I've almost never looked at the footage.

Very recently my mother asked me to turn all the VHS tapes into a digital format. I have been sitting hours/days watching footage of me and my siblings growing up. Videos at the house, friends, family, pers, everything.

I almost remember NOTHING from the footages. I am in my 30s now. Each time I watch some footage and remember a fraction of something from it, I can honestly say I can't remember anything deep in my memory.

It makes me really wonder how much I don't remember like at all. Just for some examples from the footages.

I don't remember anything about the layout of my childroom room/house throughout the years. Childhood pets, making dumb videos with family and friends, ect. 

Is this normal?

Just to help gauge my age. I was born in 91. So when I was around 9-10, video recording was at an all time peak.

Five Nights at Freddy’s got me (20M) closer to my (47F) mother :),"Basically around this time last year I was getting bored with myself, I had nothing to do and overall was just lonely and kinda sad as a person. But then one day I got this gut feeling to share one of my special gaming interests with my mother that being Five Nights at Freddy’s. It was a big part of my childhood when I was 12-13 years old &amp; only recently got back into it because of the upcoming FNaF movie which, so I decided to be brave &amp; show my mother FNaF to prepare her for the movie and overall to spend more time with her, and I absolutely DO NOT regret it! :)

We have had such a Funtime together watching Markiplier play the games. My mother has really enjoyed his commentaries and now really likes watching him because she finds him to be incredibly funny &amp; entertaining :D but she’s also gotten  incredibly invested in the overarching story of the games involving the missing children &amp; the Purple Guy in each of the games and how it all connected together! I’ve also showed her several fan songs from the games, along with the Novel Trilogy that was released which elaborates more on certain characters from the games while also introducing her to brand new ones. Don’t even get me started on all the theory videos made by (MatPat, Dawko, 8-Bit Gaming, Razzbowski, Treesicle, etc) she has some very interesting opinions on them &amp; the story overall that I’ll talk about if anyones curious.

But overall my take away from this is that, don’t always keep your interests to yourself. You might find somebody in your family may enjoy then just as much as you do. And If you do, embrace &amp; cherish it!😊",Competitive_Bid7071,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/12argwd/five_nights_at_freddys_got_me_20m_closer_to_my/,basically around time last year wa getting bored nothing overall wa lonely kinda sad person one day got gut feeling share one special gaming interest mother five night freddy wa big part childhood wa 12 13 year old amp recently got back upcoming fnaf movie decided brave amp show mother fnaf prepare movie overall spend time absolutely regret funtime together watching markiplier play game mother ha really enjoyed commentary really like watching find incredibly funny amp entertaining also gotten incredibly invested overarching story game involving missing child amp purple guy game connected together also showed several fan song game along novel trilogy wa released elaborates certain character game also introducing brand new one even get started theory video made matpat dawko 8 bit gaming razzbowski treesicle etc ha interesting opinion amp story overall talk anyones curious overall take away always keep interest might find somebody family may enjoy much embrace amp cherish,five night freddy got 20m closer 47f mother,competitive bid 7071

Does anyone else get very into something for a while and then move on to something else?,"No one else I know in my own life does this to the extremes that I do.  I'll get very fixated on one thing for a while and then lose most of my interest in it. My wife just thinks it is some quirky thing about me.  Some examples include:

Fantasy football.  I got very into to the point of having over 90 teams one year.  Now I'm down to about 5 per season and I like it, but I would never think about having that many teams again.

Drawing.  For about two years, I studied drawing and practiced a LOT.  I actually got pretty good at it, but then lost interest.  Now, I'll doodle a bit if I'm bored, but never want to sit for hours doing it.

Music.  I spent about a year playing guitar for a couple of hours per day until one day, I just didn't feel like it anymore. I have a couple of guitars sitting here that I have touched in months.

Building websites.  I have literally built hundreds of them over the years with varying degrees of success.  I'm currently coming off of a period of interest, but generally don't feel like messing with the 5 current ones I've got up.

Once, when I was a teen, I got very into fitness and lost about 65 pounds over the summer.  I'm actually trying to get THAT vibe back.

What is the best way to thank a super generous food worker?,"I posted about this on another page and the TL;DR is that a food worker very early on (3rd time seeing me) kept giving me free food on top of the food I already paid for. It started with her, after I ordered my food, asking if I wanted a side as if I wanted to order more, to which I declined. When she said she'd give it on the house, I declined because inflation is crazy right now; Then it followed with her flat out putting the free side in my bag the next time. And now it's her adding full dishes/meals that cost equal to or around the same price as what I paid for.

I've spent a good month or so finding logical reasons as to why she keeps doing this but none make sense (1. No need to keep me as a customer because they have plenty. the food she gives me cost more than what I tip. Plus I imagine those tips: signing via credit card, go to the store and not her). I even asked people from the country that the store and she is based in and they still don't really add up. So, I kind of just accepted it for a few weeks. 

I was thinking of just personally tipping her the equivalent of the free food she's given me ($54.26 up to this point) wishing her well and then not coming back again. I'll miss that dish I always order but I just don't know. Consistent free things while being a new customer seemed odd to me. So, casual redditors how would you go about managing a situation like this?

TL;DR (from previous post) Manager (waitress? server?) quickly began giving free food on top of the food I pay for and I don't know why. No one I know gets free food from there either. Thanks y'all.

EDIT- I posted this about an hour before I was headed to the restaurant. And the answers here gave me a great idea. I ended up buying cookies for her and the staff to which they greatly appreciated. It was from there that we got to formally introduce each other (yes. I literally didn’t even know her name). Turns out she’s the manager there; hence why she has the bandwidth to keep giving me free food. I won’t stop going there (was weekly), but I will limit the amount of times; I just don’t want her to think she owes me anything or that I go there just for free food benefits. It’s just my culture and how I was raised.

I love pineapple.,"I just cut into another one. I will probably, again, eat the entire fruit within 24 hours, if not in a single setting right here.

What I think is wild is that fresh pineapples here are around $2, whereas a single can of pineapple costs $1.50.

I just think that if you have the ability to cut a pineapple or the ability to learn how to cut a pineapple (it's easier than it sounds), then why not get a fresh one?

It's $2 for an entire pineapple. They're basically giving them away. That's a bargain for a snack item.

"You're not bad at running, you just don't do it enough!","I hear from so many people that they hate running because it's ""bad for your joints"", it's exhausting, etc.  Granted some may have health issues that limit there ability to run but I'd say most are simply doing it wrong.  I see so many people try and run too far and too soon and completely out themselves off continuing when they find they struggle.  It's like trying to have a conservation in French when you can barely say Bonjour!  

Running is one the most natural activities a human being can do.  We are literally built for it!  But you need to build up to it.  Whatever pace you run at, it should feel comfortable.  If it isn't, try walking faster instead and building up the pace to a very light jog.  Running should be fun - don't worry about times or immediately trying to run 5k.

Tell me a song you sang or hummed to a baby to help them sleep that wasn’t a traditional lullaby or love song,"My baby was born early and had a month long NICU stay. Whenever I would get to do skin to skin or just hold him I found myself humming Clair de Lune. I don’t even like classical music like that, I was just a very hardcore twilight fan when I was a teenager. I remember Edward and Bella talking about it and so when I was I teenager I thought it would be soooo cool and edgy of me to know the song/tune by heart. Now, over 10 years later, I’m humming it to my kid in the NICU. Then when I finally brought him home, I started to sing him chasing pavements by Adele. I respect and like Adele a lot but not enough to buy an album or a ticket to see her. I just think it is so funny the songs that came to my mind to sing my son to sleep are songs that aren’t even my favorite songs like my wedding song or even a traditional baby lullaby.

How do you come to appreciate others’ wealth instead of envying it?,"I (27F) live with my best friend. We are very close and I really love our friendship. But, we come from very different backgrounds. My family used to be quite poor, but we somewhat had a happy home (despite an alcoholic father and traumas from this, my siblings and I are a resilient bunch). While we have been able to mobilise up the economic ladder, we still live pay check to pay check and so when I have difficult months, I hardly have the option of asking for money or support from my fam. 
I was a bit fine with this, until I heard my best-friend ask her parents for money and a new Mac book, and then after the call looked at me with all seriousness and said “actually I should ask them to buy me an apartment”. 

I won’t lie, a sliver of pain shot through my heart and I was drenched in envy, but mostly self pity. Asking for a new  laptop, let alone  a house, is something we joke about in my family. It’s a conversation filler. Something we say when we realise there’s been too much silence in the room, followed by a giggle lol.

My question is, how can I navigate this situation without feeling envy? How can I appreciate that this kind of blessed life, where things are simply asked for and immediately received, actually exists. I want to look at my friend and think “wow, this is a beautiful life and I’m glad I get to witness it” instead of “what is it about me that doesn’t deserve this kind of reality?”.

I (23F) just had such a comically bad night out and I have to share it,"Basically, my college friend - Terry (23F) - calls me up today and invites me to a bar with her friend Viola (20F) and a guy from Spain - Mathias (23M) (all names are made up).

I think about whether I should go, since I'm tired and short on money. I set on not going, but at 9pm Terry hits me up saying they're at this arcade place and I should join them, they're drinking, it's super fun

My fomo kicks in, I get ready and go. 12am - I arrive to the arcade-bar. It looks nothing like on their website, it's a very cheap looking basement bar. I can't pay by card, so I end up going out to withdraw cash.

I come back, Terry and Viola are pretty drunk. I drink my Skinny Bitch cocktail and the 2 of them + Matthias push for getting tequila shots. They had 4 before I arrived. I am against cause I am a tequila hater + they're drunk. Eventually, I cave in. At the bar turns out they're short on cash so I end up buying tequila shot for Terry.

While waiting for our shots the 2 girls are all over me - hugging and touching - while I hate physical touch and it's hot af in that basement. Anyways.

We get shots - it's horrible. Terry disappears immediately to the bathroom, saying she doesn't feel well. I end up playing a bunch of this arcade games and I lose all of them... I also payed for those lmao

Afterwards we go looking for Terry since it's been a while. She's a MESS. She's throwing up, Viola goes into a stall with her, me and Mathias end up thinking how to get home. I end up getting water and looking for plastic bags. Terry breaks a glass with water, Viola's bleeding cause she cut herself on the glass. Long story short - while Terry was throwing a tantrum about not leaving the bathroom stall I had to quite roughly force her out to get some air and go home (she was afraid to throw up on the way even though we could tell she physically couldn't lmao).

We're out on the street. Viola wanted to take public transportation to which I said absolutely not - Terry can't even stand on her own. Viola and Mathias have their phones with no battery. I end up taking Terry's phone to call Uber, to which Terry - in the mids of her being drunk - starts looking for promo codes cause the trip's expensive lmao.

I check my phone and boom! I have uber promo code. I end up ordering a car from my account and paying for it since they have no cash. After sending Terry, Viola and Mathias home (they live together) I look at my screen only to realise.... I can't order an Uber for myself while they're driving 💀

I end up taking a bus home. I get home at 3am and just laugh uncontrollably cause I REALLY should've just stayed home and watched that Adam Sandler/Jennifer Aniston movie lmao

I ran my first half marathon!!!,"It was so much better than I expected. 

I’ve been running for 2 years. In the past year I started running 4 times a week and taking it more seriously. I decided in October I would run my local half marathon. 

Today I ran the race. I was expecting/wishing for 02:00. I finished the half marathon in 01:51!!!!!!!!

I started off and felt amazing physically, I was whizzing by at 5:20/km pace and felt so comfortable and nice, but somewhat sceptical because I previously thought I’d be clinging on to 5:40/km pace the whole time.

Is it selfish for me to not buy gifts for my family members on their birthday or on any holiday,"I want to start off by first saying, im 21and that it's not so much that I don't want to buy my family gifts anymore but it's the fact that right now I need to save money, and for the past four years I feel I have been spending way too much on every single one of my immediate family members. To the point, I feel like I am being taken advantage of. For example, my dad has stopped getting Christmas gifts and has been slowly cutting down on birthday gifts for the family, but I feel like there is an expectation that because I work, and because I'm not paying household bills I must contribute to gift-giving. I told my mum the other day that I didn't get her anything for her birthday and she sounded slightly disappointed and huffed a bit so I said I can get you something another day cause I couldn't find her anything and we can go together, so we did and we looked at different stores for the clothing item she might like, she said she doesn't want me to spend too much and doesn't think the item should be worth over £100 but that it's the only one she likes and would prefer it. So I got it for her over the one she didn't like as much which I didn't exactly mind doing. But I'm now thinking when it comes to me most of the time I feel kind of disappointed. But that's not even the main reason, the main reason is  I am financially struggling as I am balancing work and school studies right now and my job doesn't pay me enough to save, pay for expenses, and to buy gifts for people. I honestly don't know what to do.",funnymoan,11,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/12aeu30/is_it_selfish_for_me_to_not_buy_gifts_for_my/,want start first saying im 21and much want buy family gift anymore fact right need save money past four year feel spending way much every single one immediate family member point feel like taken advantage example dad ha stopped getting christmas gift ha slowly cutting birthday gift family feel like expectation work paying household bill must contribute gift giving told mum day get anything birthday sounded slightly disappointed huffed bit said get something another day cause find anything go together looked different store clothing item might like said want spend much think item worth 100 one like would prefer got one like much exactly mind thinking come time feel kind disappointed even main reason main reason financially struggling balancing work school study right job pay enough save pay expense buy gift people honestly know,selfish buy gift family member birthday holiday,funny moan
Monsters university has one of the best morals out of animated movies,"I know there are a lot of movies with a great moral to the story but I feel as far as kids movies are concerned monsters university was really good.

Many movies of this sort tend to be cliche in that the protagonist simply needs to ""believe in themselves"" and that they can accomplish the goal they set out for, typically after failing multiple times. Or often that they can accomplish absolutely anything if they work on it.

I liked how monsters university showed that people have different talents and we have to accept that there are things we just aren't equipped to be good at, no matter how hard we work.

Wazoski works his whole life to be a scarer, it's his childhood dream, he puts in so much hard work but he's just not scary and there's nothing he can do about it. But instead of failing and later becoming scary in some cliche manner, he finds that his talent lies in leadership and orchestrating the scares.

Now I know all this is extremely obvious if you've watched the movie and I'm not writing this post as some kind of epiphany but moreso how I thought it made the movie unique.",Dark_Raiden_,15,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/129te28/monsters_university_has_one_of_the_best_morals/,know lot movie great moral story feel far kid movie concerned monster university wa really good many movie sort tend cliche protagonist simply need believe accomplish goal set typically failing multiple time often accomplish absolutely anything work liked monster university showed people different talent accept thing equipped good matter hard work wazoski work whole life scarer childhood dream put much hard work scary nothing instead failing later becoming scary cliche manner find talent lie leadership orchestrating scare know extremely obvious watched movie writing post kind epiphany moreso thought made movie unique,monster university ha one best moral animated movie,dark raid en

I think its silly to attribute quotes to characters instead of the people writing their script,"I was thinking of the quote ""It is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. That is not a weakness. That is life."", spoken by Patrick Stewart on Star Trek: TNG. The line is commonly attributed to his character, Jean-Luc Picard. Maybe its because he's a figure of authority on the show, so it seems more inspirational to attribute it to him. But David Kemper wrote the episode, so unless the line was ad-libbed, Kemper should get the attribution.

Getting into writing novels,"Title. I'm not a very creative person, I want to be experimental but my brain falls flat whenever I try to think of new things to make. I still kind of enjoy laying out the plot, I'm terrified because I have no clue what people even consider good and I'm 14, so i have worse cringe avoiders then everybody else. I'm planning to make fun of tropes on Wattpad but instead of just writing ""tropes that Wattpad writers use"" I'm going to actually make a story.

I know, I'm a genius. I even tell myself every time I hyperfixate on small details I left. I didn't actually intend for the story to make fun of tropes from the start, I kind of just wrote an adaptation of a trashy animation and the theme of the story somehow fell into place. I like that thrill sorta, like I have no clue what I'm doing but it's raw and I'm going to do it but I probably still need work on my style of writing. Also it's moments like this where like ""oh I can capture this feeling I feel and stuff it into my book"" but then I go ""lmao I have no clue how to do that."" I like working hard for what I accomplish, but I also like plowing through it no skill ez. And whenever luck decides to go ""yo here's a poptart"" I just get pissed because ""aw I don't get to get the feeling of payoff or the feeling that I'm a literary genius, I'm sad now :( ""

I am planning to make a MGS like video where the best friend reveals that he's been part of the conspiracy theory all along but that might be too overboard and ruin the wholesome ending. I'm also going to make an intro video where i take Tusk, I absolutely don't get sued for copyrights and then paste it in a video where the MC is just walking down the street sweating while the bully is doing the middle finger or something.

"Not sure what to make of life being an endless cycle of work, exercise, sleep, repeat","When I was a kid, I was told the most important thing was to get a decent career, then you could be happy.   When I made it to Engineering school, we all believed that once we graduated, we would be living the dream.  After graduating, I got an engineering job, and my friends who haven't graduated yet always tell me how I must finally be living the dream. 

But all I can think of is... is this it?   Is this the dream that people strive for?    The one thing that really bugs me is realizing that, from here on out, its going to be the same thing every week for the rest of my life.  Work, eat, do sports (for exercise) , sleep.   Wake up the next day and repeat.   See friends once in awhile on weekends.  Then go back and its the same again, work, eat, exercise, sleep.   I'm not really sure where I'm going with my life, I'm just repeating the endless cycle.   I feel neither particularly happy nor unhappy.   My mood can be described as a flat line most of the time, unexciting, uneventful, with little blips when I get to see each friend every few weeks.

I saw in the oncoming traffic lane a, you guessed it, coyote.

Should I quit my 9-5 sales job and go back to serving????,"
I am 23 years old and just graduated college a year ago. I jumped right into a sales job after college where the money is decent, management is great and I get to work from home a couple days a week. I enjoy sales but it can be demanding/difficult. The company offers PTO, but since it’s a sales job, it’s hard to step away for a vacation to relax when you are still expected to hit your quota on the month.

I feel that I have already become burnt out from this job and am considering quitting this job to go back to serving for more money, less hours, flexibility to travel, enjoy more free time and focus on learning new skills to hopefully work for myself some day. I served all through college and loved it, and also made great money working much less hours than I am working now. I am thinking of doing this for 1-2 years, while figuring out if I can work for myself. If it doesn’t work out, I can always go back to a corporate job, but my lack of experience in the field may make that difficult since I’ve only been working this job for 1 year. However, I also feel like now would be the best time in my life to do this, as I am still able to utilize my parents health insurance until 26 years old.

A Heartwarming Gesture from a Friend Halfway Across the World," 

Hey everyone! I just wanted to share a little story that brightened up my day and reminded me of the power of friendship, even when you're miles apart.

So, I came to the UK for studies about a year ago, and while it has been a great experience overall, I started to feel homesick recently. The thing I was missing the most was the food from my country, India. The taste, the spices, the warmth – it's a unique experience that I just couldn't find here.

As the homesickness grew, I started feeling really down and lost my motivation to do anything. I didn't realize how much it was affecting me until one of my closest friends from back home noticed my change in behavior.

You won't believe what she did next!

She took it upon herself to order some authentic Indian food online and had it delivered straight to my doorstep here in the UK! I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the delivery guy at my door with a package full of delicious Indian treats.

Her kind gesture filled me with happiness and gratitude. It's amazing how something as simple as food from home can lift your spirits and bring a sense of comfort. Not only did it help with my homesickness, but it also reminded me of the wonderful friendships I have and the importance of staying connected, no matter the distance.

I just wanted to share this story with all of you to remind us that even the smallest acts of kindness can make a huge difference in someone's life.

I'm a good driver and yet I keep having terrible driving dreams.,"I am a bit of a late bloomer in the driving scene.  I got my license back in August 2022 and I'm in my 30's (don't judge me, I didn't get around to it).  After acquiring my vehicle in September and owning it for over half a year, I'm very comfortable with road trips and I rarely have issues (aside missing a few turns or getting into traffic).

Whenever I have dreams that involve driving, Murphy's Law goes into overdrive with some abnormalities.  For starters, **why is it that I can't reach the brake peddle in my dreams?**  Every single time I am moving slowly, I am unable to stop because the peddle if out of reach.  I literally have to slide off my seat and stretch my leg just to push it with my foot.

I just recently had another dream where I was driving a friend home from work.  For some odd reason, my car had a second steering wheel on the right side, but it was so badly designed that I had to switch back.  Not long after that, I was driving a few more friends (don't ask me how they got in) until the main steering wheel suddenly switched to the right!  The event was like magic and everyone reacted with laughter.  Meanwhile, I'm panicking by reaching over and attempting to avoid collusions (because the guy in the passenger seat doesn't know how to drive).

"Domino effect, stopping the cycle!","Hey guys! I am feeling particularly lazy the last week. Its currently 9:40 AM and it already feels like the day is doomed to be unproductive. Yesterday i learned humans react to their surrounding like it’s happening in a domino(?). So if you are lonely - isolation - sadness and if you are happy - meet friends - have energy - clean your room - happier. 

I just need to stop the next domino! 

My goal for today to be a success is to dry my hair now that I showered, buy some food as I don’t have anything, clean my room quickly, GO TO THE LIBRARY AND STUDY! It’s ridiculous how LAZY! I am lately. And it’s not procrastination, i already have an average of 50 hours of studying per module behind me which is …. I guess pretty normal… it’s lethargy.

"I keep wanting to change myself based on small things, and lose touch with my emotions. Any advice?","     Hello everyone, i’m just generally curious if anyone can give advice on the way i’m feeling lately. 

I hope I don’t end up sounding insane or crazy, but I get influenced by the SMALLEST things. For some reason I feel like I need to have my entire personality based off of my music, style, etc. 
For more context, I listen to a lot of rock, metal, heavy metal, and so on. 

Here’s where it’s going to get a little strange, my mind can accept the fact that I can listen to other genres of music such as R&amp;B but as soon as I listen to it, I become an entire different person. 

I rarely listen to any type of pop but my favorite pop artist is Ariana Grande, when I listen to her music I feel as if I change completely. My style, fashion, taste in EVERYTHING changes. 

Then two days later, I listen to my everyday rock playlist and I go back to my other personality. It feels like I have a personality for some genres of music because I’ll change as a person completely. 

Now let’s talk about the emotions part, I can never stick to feeling just one emotion, and I mean my emotions will change quickly. I cry EXTREMELY easily. I’m an overly emotional person. So I’ll be having a good day and the slightest, TINIEST thing can make me go from normal, to fuming mad and my entire day is ruined. 

Sometimes I wake up and feel little to no emotion, like an empty slate. Completely blank. 

I’d like to consider myself to be an affectionate person, but there will be weeks that go by where I can not stand any type of affection. The words and actions of love completely disgust and irritate me beyond words. But when that passes, i love hugs, telling people I love them, and so on. 

This makes it difficult for me to maintain any sort of relationships, I’ve ruined my happiest relationship with somebody because I woke up and my love for them felt like it disappeared. I played the waiting game and decided to end it because I didn’t want to hurt them. I felt nothing for months and one day all the love I had for him came crashing back and it’s been two years, surprise, surprise, I think about him multiple times a week and regret it. 

Last but not least, I have really impulsive urges. My hair used to be down to my waist, I started cutting it an inch a week to about my shoulders. One day out of nowhere, I messaged my friend and she ended up shaving my hair. I finally let it grow out to where it was at my shoulders and last week I cut it to my chin. 

These last three weeks i’ve been overthinking like CRAZY, I’ve barely been feeling any type of emotion and the only reason i’m writing this and sharing it is because I’m losing it and don’t know what to do. 

Any advice is GREATLY appreciated. :)",Perfect_Cellist2358,6,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/12ad35j/i_keep_wanting_to_change_myself_based_on_small/,hello everyone generally curious anyone give advice way feeling lately hope end sounding insane crazy get influenced smallest thing reason feel like need entire personality based music style etc context listen lot rock metal heavy metal going get little strange mind accept fact listen genre music r amp b soon listen become entire different person rarely listen type pop favorite pop artist ariana grande listen music feel change completely style fashion taste everything change two day later listen everyday rock playlist go back personality feel like personality genre music change person completely let talk emotion part never stick feeling one emotion mean emotion change quickly cry extremely easily overly emotional person good day slightest tiniest thing make go normal fuming mad entire day ruined sometimes wake feel little emotion like empty slate completely blank like consider affectionate person week go stand type affection word action love completely disgust irritate beyond word pass love hug telling people love make difficult maintain sort relationship ruined happiest relationship somebody woke love felt like disappeared played waiting game decided end want hurt felt nothing month one day love came crashing back two year surprise surprise think multiple time week regret last least really impulsive urge hair used waist started cutting inch week shoulder one day nowhere messaged friend ended shaving hair finally let grow wa shoulder last week cut chin last three week overthinking like crazy barely feeling type emotion reason writing sharing losing know advice greatly appreciated,keep wanting change based small thing lose touch emotion advice,perfect cellist 2358

I forgot what it was like to feel genuine appreciation for the things I do for others. She sent me a voice message explaining her appreciation and just general happiness over this small act. Hearing it made me tear up, I felt valued for the first time in months and I know its stupid to say that but its something I've been missing. I enjoy bringing others happiness and making others smile so when I could hear the literal joy in her voice it just made me so happy. I didn't expect to feel like this at all, I was just hoping to brighten up her day a little bit.",ToWhomItMayConcern47,6,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/129d6xl/i_sent_my_friend_flowers_to_help_cheer_her_up/,recently reconnected friend talked found going little bit rough patch decided send flower cheer response brought much happiness back story rough patch relationship nothing able ha made feel like working anymore giving month receive little nothing return response got sending flower purely platonic friend wa shock forgot wa like feel genuine appreciation thing others sent voice message explaining appreciation general happiness small act hearing made tear felt valued first time month know stupid say something missing enjoy bringing others happiness making others smile could hear literal joy voice made happy expect feel like wa hoping brighten day little bit,sent friend flower help cheer,may concern 47
I’m traveling abroad for the first time in my life!,"I’m finally stepping outside the country after nearly 30 years of existence, and I’m thrilled! It’s a family trip, and my parents decided on it kind of impulsively, so we didn’t get the best deals. (It was painful seeing all that money go down the drain. But they’re paying for it, so who am I to complain?)

I didn’t want to go because it was too sudden and seemed like a lot of work. I also felt like I won’t have enough time to research and create the itinerary, especially since I’m busy with work and other things and my siblings won’t help me. (The curse of being the responsible child.) Plus, it’s my first time creating an itinerary for an overseas trip. I’m also a huge perfectionist, and a part of me wants the itinerary to be perfect, even though I’m perfectly aware it’s impossible and I can’t possibly know everything.

Anyway, I spent the weekend working on the itinerary and booking everything that needs to be booked online. Just a bit more and we’ll be all set!

As I said, I was hesitant at first, but now I can’t wait for it.

And as it turns out, I actually *love* creating a travel itinerary—especially as someone who’s obsessed with planning, researching, and synthesizing information.

I will likely never have children,"I (43 F) will likely never have children, and I'm a bit sad about it. At one point in life, I wanted six kids. Then, the number declined over time.

Well, now it seems the window is about closed, and somehow I went through life, putting my all into my career, traveling, and just doing other things, that having children just never happened.

I read ‘The Damned Utd’ by David Peace,"

The Damn United is a biographical novel which about the tumultuous tenure of legendary manager Brian Clough with Leeds United in the first division of English football, in the 1974 - 1975 season. 

The narrative is in the form of stream of consciousness from Clough’s perspective as he grapples with his demons to steer redeem his managerial career and steer Leeds United to footballing success. 

Peace’s writing is visceral and reads like a thriller. He does a fantastic job in bringing to light the grimy realities of British society of the 70s. 

Peace’s prose employs terse repetitions to built a sense of rhythm, momentum and desperation to the narrative. I found his writing to be reminiscent of the Austrian writer Thomas Berhard’s long-winded, maniacal monologues.

What is the true average person?,"I recently got a free car after my old one blew the transmission. The car was free for a reason, it runs like trash. It was an old farm van that was about to be dropped off at the dump, but I was given it instead. It does not accelerate very well, or by well I mean quickly. It is at the end of its life.

Since I'm in this 'new' van, I see so many people getting frustrated with me on the road. I always do the speed limit or at least 10 over, and I am tailgated to no end. I feel like at the end of the work day, everyone is trying to get home asap and is aggressively trying to get there. I will have someone tailgating me, with multiple opportunities to pass me, not do so. After that I feel fine doing the speed limit.

However this has got me thinking, how many people are angry or unhappy with their lives. Why are so many drivers tailgating me doing 70km/h in a 60? I also have recently cut out my sister and my younger brother in my life. They have unchecked anger/aggressive issues and I couldn't take it anymore. I want space from the negativity. 

since seeking space from the unchecked anger and negativity from my family, I have noticed it in many places in public, like when driving. I don't know if this is a me issue. I don't know if I am super sensitive to other peoples negativity and pick it up, or if most people are in fact, angry.

Quit my job within 3 months (genz😛),"Generation Z is not willing to sacrifice their well-being and self-respect for a job that fails to recognize their worth.""

 Info: 
After joining a startup at the beginning of the year, I initially did well, being punctual and completing my tasks. However, things quickly escalated as I was asked to come in earlier, leave later, and take on more responsibilities due to a coworker leaving. Despite not receiving a raise, I continued to do my best until I found myself being micromanaged by both my boss and manager. I was doing 60% of the work alone, and one day, I had to wait at the office gate for an hour because the manager was late and had not informed me beforehand. Despite having a fever, I had still gone to the office because the work was urgent. Later, the manager became upset with me for leaving and making him do the work alone.""

Does nobody question how weird a concept amusement parks are?,"The weather has finally gotten warm in the Northern hemisphere, so everyone has been talking about amusement parks. People seem self-taught to see amusement parks as the embodiment of happiness. Those rides that are just like every other ride except with different loops, taller heights, slightly different views. The slightly odd food. All that walking. I have a friend who made a cartoon on YouTube a while ago (it's still up) that was a parody of this, where archeologists thousands of years from now unearthed Disneyworld asking what the huge giant metal structures and costumed entertainers were and wondered if Disneyworld was an avant-garde city-state like the Mayans had.

I don't mean this as a vent (it's not a vent), I'm used to not liking them as much as other people, and I know I won't be the only one who can relate. I was in a video chat owned by my school I've attended, and every year around this time they announce an end of the year trip to somewhere fun for students who had good grades/behavior (unless the criteria is different). This grew into what could be described as a solemn conversation as I casually mentioned a few times that riding rides, walking the walks, etc. is more like a chore for me for medical reasons, and asked ""could we get a separate trip somewhere for those of us who don't enjoy amusement parks"". There was a long silence, like what I asked was super unheard of. I don't ever remember riding a ride before or after I moved to America, but I've noticed when you say that out loud, it has an air to it like ""wow she was sheltered"", maybe in spite of the fact tycoons spend millions of dollars building individual roller coasters (so maybe they're trained to ask themselves ""who won't ride this"").

I didn't think I'd spend so much time asking myself about roller coasters today, whether the fact someone might not enjoy amusement parks (it's in the name) is a real oddity, a real rarity, a perceived oddity, or a rare oddity, whether it's cultural or if there aren't many who strongly prefer other adventures. The only metaphor I can describe it with is stumbling upon Willy Wonka's factory and being the one person who only likes vanilla candy and asking ""is this a thing"", it seems like a funday gamechanger.

"""Social media is fake"" how do you feel about this statement?","We've all heard the common claim that social media is fake, and that we should return to our real lives to form real relationships.

But that just ain't true! In fact, it's the complete opposite. In real life, we have to pretend to be great, good, happy people. Every move we make in a social interaction affects how our relationships and social standing will be in the future. compare that to social media. Social media is anonymous.

i am confused,"I'm in an anxiety attack right now, instead of going into shock, I feel my imperfect body burn. I feel the burn, it's at the back of my neck and down my spine, I feel the heat in my belly and the tightness in my chest. The accumulated urge to cry never really went away, now it's huge, but still nothing happens. It's night and everyone is in their rooms, there's nothing else to do, and the feeling of having nothing to do adds to the heat and tightness, I could sleep, but I don't want to, the warning signal could keep me awake at night. all night and I'll never have control. I feel confused, I overthink things, but does this make me smarter, and why do I care so much about it? What if everyone thinks like that? I am dumb? why do i care so much about this? Don't compare yourself to other people you don't stand a chance.a And I, I compare myself. I have never admired any girl as much as I do now, suppressing it was a bad decision, now I feel even more alone, I can't get over Helena, my mind is winning once again, admiring someone is stronger than carnal passion, and it's more painful when things don't turn out the way you'd like, when I think about it it's like a scratchy, endless scream of youth that constantly wants to be lived and that knows it's going to die, and I haven't learned to deal with it, time passes and I feel further away from anything, I'm not the same as before, that's not bad, but I don't want to say that it's good, and if it's indifferent why do I care so much? Sometimes I think that the internet may have messed with my head, and now I remember a printed shirt, and the print was like me and her, then I remember the hallways of college, what would I have done if I stayed there? Respect, emotional respect to sebr the time to say a yes or no. And it's true that I'll always have affection for her, the burning in my stomach continues and I want to throw up, I'm throwing up my thoughts now, who knows, maybe this will change something? At night, Belo Horizonte is still alive now that we are young people walking around in the early morning, each one wanting to get home and feel safe again. I feel bad and guilty the next day every time I leave the house. The lights and the emptiness increase the heat and the tightness, daydreams, daydreams, daydreams, I want to scream and I want to cry, I want to go back in the roast, I want to blow my head off with a twelve, I want to feel safe, I need a sincere hug, I miss sincerity in people, I feel that I'm being judged, I feel that others don't like me, am I right? Is it social phobia? But what if it's social phobia and I'm still right, what if it's a knack for figuring out what others think about me? Did that seem like a dumb thought? No? So was it smart? No?

Kids who made me reconsider the thought of going childfree,"I don't know why but I love these kids so much. Personally, I don't have any relatives so usually my friend's relatives become my relatives. A few months back I happened to meet his cousins who are all 10F, 8F, and 7M. I used to think of not having kids before meeting them but just spending a day with them made me reconsider it. 

Fast-forward to last December his cousins from the US (11F &amp; 9M) and Dubai (12F) came to spend their holidays. We spent the month playing with all six of them and listening to the stories they told. I consider those days to be the best of my life (of course, I only realized it later). I literally shed tears when they left. Since then, the words they spoke, their laughs and the days I've spent with them are living rent-free in my mind. I can't stop thinking about them. I'm always thinking of giving them gifts once I get a job and doing anything to see them happy. 

Maybe it's because these kids are nothing like our typical annoying neighbor kids. These kids are well-behaved, pure-hearted, and always sport a smile. They have to be protected at all costs. All thanks to the parenting. These kids pushed me to have baby fever at the age of 21.

Although I would love to see them grow up and succeed in their lives and to try to be a mentor and role model in the process, I'm lowkey afraid that we might lose touch over time, and it kinda bugs me to think they won't be as excited to see me as they are now when I visit them.",MoeJoeMJ,11,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/128ybtf/kids_who_made_me_reconsider_the_thought_of_going/,know love kid much personally relative usually friend relative become relative month back happened meet cousin 10f 8f 7m used think kid meeting spending day made reconsider fast forward last december cousin u 11f amp 9m dubai 12f came spend holiday spent month playing six listening story told consider day best life course realized later literally shed tear left since word spoke laugh day spent living rent free mind stop thinking always thinking giving gift get job anything see happy maybe kid nothing like typical annoying neighbor kid kid well behaved pure hearted always sport smile protected cost thanks parenting kid pushed baby fever age 21 although would love see grow succeed life try mentor role model process lowkey afraid might lose touch time kinda bug think excited see visit,kid made reconsider thought going childfree,moe joe mj

I dislike being made to feel bad by my reatives who are looking to immigrate to the US because i dont want the same.,"I am tired of being made to feel less than by my relatives who are trying to immegrate to the US.

I come from a under developed or developing nation that has a huge diasphora. 

 I am tired of my uncle living in the US and looking to gain citizenship there, visit us only to get a health check ups. My grandmother has a ""health friend card"" issued by the government that offers free or cheap healthcare to everyone in her family. Uncle got a cavity and took a leave during Christmas to visit us and get his tooth fixed on our governments money. My father took him to there and he apparently complained and laughed about everything he saw on the street on the way.
 Imagine how that makes my father feel.

 You arent fleeing a war. A good life is possible in this country,  and its okay if you choose to have a better one. But then stick by your choice and dont pretend like someone kicked you out. My grandmothers generation was a refugee generation and she speakes about ""home"" with a pang of sadness coz she really cant go back no matter what. Then there is my cousin (said uncles' daughter) making reels saying stuff like ""smell of chai is smell of home and how she misses home"". I am sorry you face racism in the US but yours and grandmas experiences are different. Both valid, but different. 

You have been here twice. No you dont know what its like to navigate our festivals.  I know that so stop telling me how to do things based on the much muted celebration you have there. Also, stop asking me to visit and try the american dream the minute i mention some inconvenience.

 This is a free world and people should be allowed to choose their way through life and i support that.  I myself do not want to  leave. I just feel like if i have to uproot my life, what i get in return has to be 99% perfect. I am okay with my crappy life in my crappy country, i should not be made to feel bad about that.

"Last week I realised that if we ever managed to live to 200, our retirement age would be 170.","I was discussing this the other day with a friend.

We were having a chat and he said something about retirement. I replied ""The retirement age is 67 now in the UK, and we are in our late 30s. By the time we are 67, the retirement age will easily be 75."".

He said ""No way in hell! What's the point then?"".

But I get it. Retirement was originally ""engineered"" by the government for people who worked all their lives so they can have an easy 5-10 years before they die. It is not sustainable to hold for \~30-40 years because people live longer now.

So, if we ever get to live up to 200, 30 years of retirement sounds pretty good right now.",awesome_pinay_noses,8,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/1280f0q/last_week_i_realised_that_if_we_ever_managed_to/,wa discussing day friend chat said something retirement replied retirement age 67 uk late 30 time 67 retirement age easily 75 said way hell point get retirement wa originally engineered government people worked life easy 5 10 year die sustainable hold 30 40 year people live longer ever get live 200 30 year retirement sound pretty good right,last week realised ever managed live 200 retirement age would 170,awesome pinay nose

"I'm watching videos to learn about mycology, and I find it interesting how the PowerPoints are in English, but the speaker alides between English and an Indian language.","I'm a nerd and wanted to know more about mushrooms, so I went of YouTube since hearing someone speak is easier that digging through a book for me.

The playlist I found seems to be what I was looking for, but as I watched the first video I became disoriented.  
The speaker definitely was saying words English in an Indian accent, so I figured I just had to listen harder to catch what she was saying.

""Her whiteboard was in English, so OF COURSE she must be speaking English"" I thought.

lol it took me a few minutes to be certain that she was absolutely NOT speaking English. Or... I mean she WAS. She did. She'd say whole phrases and go back to her board and point out things, but she would also flow into whatever other language she was using.

It just kinda hit me that that's probably what it's like in a place where English isnt the ""home language,"" but still the dominant one for academics and business.  
I find  it funny how the powerpoints/boards are still in English despite the language being spoken.  
It reminded me somewhat of Spanglish, but Spanglish is usually just for casual settings so it was funny to see a ""Spanglish"" used in an academic setting.

Back To The Future,"I know this has been discussed before but it still blows my mind.  Back to the future was released in 1985.  In the movie they go back 30 years to 1955.  If we went back 30 years from today we would only be in 1993. 

If the movie was filmed today and they wanted to get to 1955, they would have to go back 68 years.  There aren’t even that many people alive today (less than 2%) who would actually remember 1955.  They would have to be at least 78 which would have made them 10 years old at the time.",ajd416,9,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/12881ge/back_to_the_future/,know ha discussed still blow mind back future wa released 1985 movie go back 30 year 1955 went back 30 year today would 1993 movie wa filmed today wanted get 1955 would go back 68 year even many people alive today le 2 would actually remember 1955 would least 78 would made 10 year old time,back future,jd 416
Why do significantly older men I’ve never met a day in my life always say hi to me in public?,"I’m referring to the older men that I pass by on the sidewalk or on the train or when I’m just in places in public where it’s not really a sit-down setting or a normal place where people might approach others to meet new people. I understand in situations where you’re just being polite, like if you get in the same elevator as someone or if you actually have any reason to interact with that person, but I mean this literally happens to me while I’ll be clearly focused on something else or actively going somewhere and not trying to make friends. At first, the question was more of “why are strangers always saying hi to me in public?” But I quickly realized it’s literally only older men that I experience this with. A woman has never done this to me. I also don’t really experience it with guys my age I’ve noticed. They usually walk past me or if they want to interact with me they’ll go out of their way to come up to me and talk to me and try to have a conversation. 




I understand it takes less than a second out of both of our day but I still don’t understand what makes them want to say hi to me. There are times they’ll come up and try to start a conversation and in those times, it makes sense because then at least I find out why they’re approaching me, like if they’re hitting on me or something but more often than not it’s just a “hi :)” or even a “hi how are you” and at this point I want to straight up respond with “do I know you?” Because I literally don’t know why they’re talking to me.




I think it’s fucking creepy and there’s a sense of self entitlement that I can feel radiating off them that they assume I’m going to be polite and by impulse reaction say hi back and give them the satisfaction. I always ignore them.

Last Night I Immortalized my Dad in my first D&amp;D Campaign,"A little over a year ago while visiting home for Christmas, I tried to run a small 30-minute D&amp;D encounter for my family. I had been playing for years and they were curious how it worked. Wrote all of them characters and gave it a shot. My Mom and sister loved it, and I'm sure my dad would have, if he had been able to stay awake through it! He had always worked a lot and was prone to falling asleep just about \*anywhere\*. About four minutes in, he started snoring while still sitting up, and so we all just laughed and let him rest. All in all, a successful game!

Unfortunately he did pass a few months ago, a few days after Christmas. I moved home to be close to my Mom and sister, and they convinced me to DM a longer running game, which I happily agreed! Last night during our introductory session, I decided to introduce a ""Sleepy Knight"", inspired by my Dad's Knight character he ""played"" that night so long ago by sleeping through it. During the session, he followed the party around yawning, and deciding to grab a quick nap anytime the real fighting started. It resulted in smiles and laughs from the family, immortalizing him into the game and allowing that funny memory to live on with us. I think I'll make sure he tags along for future adventures.

The region beta paradox,"Imagine the following: If you need to travel less than a mile, you walk. If you need to go more than a mile, you drive. Paradoxically, you will travel 2 miles faster than you travel 1. That means worse situations can sometimes be better than better situations.

One difference I noticed between Facebook users and Redditors,"I used to watch a lot of nature videos on Facebook Watch, aka, wild animal hunting videos. In the comment sections of those videos, you can always see a lot of people blaming the cameraman for not saving the poor little preyed animals. Of course there are always another group of people disagreeing with them, saying something like “this is not right. That’s how nature works. That’s the only way carnivorous animals survive”. But those words don’t work at all, as those people would refute “ok let the lion have your mother and I’d love to see you sitting still and enjoying the way nature works”.

Ironically, if the predator is a cute animal, for example, cats, orcas or polar bears, you’ll see almost no people of such. Few or no people would blame the cameraman for not intervening. I smh when I realized this.

Reddit also has a lot of wild animals hunting videos, but in the comments it’s always people admiring the amazing skill of the animal. Almost nobody would say stupid shit like “why is the people filming and not saving the poor deer!”

"people who have moved far away from home later in life(30+), What made you do it? And was it the right choice?","Heyy everyone, I am 29f and I am thinking about moving 9 hours away from where I currently live. I am a single mother to a 5f. I've been debating of moving for a long time. When I was a teenager I planned on moving to a big city (I grew up in a small town) but that never happened for me. I got pregnant at 23 and suddenly became single, I moved into my sisters house while I was pregnant and have experienced a lot of abuse since then.

Anyways, now that I am turning 30 in a few months and have gotten some of my independence back since having my baby, I really want to move. I am currently stuck in this rental/housing market, living with my mother who has always been abusive towards me. I have been saving my money and I will be ready to move in the summer, I am planning to move for Aug as I want to move between school semesters for my child.

I am currently planning on moving to a city where I know no one. That was not my original plan as I was thinking to move to my brothers city that is currently 11 hours away from me. However due to a language curve I would rather stay in a city 9 hours away that speaks the same language as me and I can keep my current bank and whatnot.

I have not told many people my plan as I found many people including my family always immediately dismiss all my thoughts and feelings. However, today I told one of my friends who I've been keeping relatively updated, however she made a comment that I was running away. She also grew up abused and has no family support, but she does have a romantic partner that shes had long term. 

Personally I do not feel like I am running away. I feel like I am running to a freedom I have never had before, and I will no longer be around people who have abused me as a child. I want the fresh start that I was chastised for. 

I can see how this maybe considered 'running away' since I want to escape all my abusers and I want to have freedom, and I want to stop feeling like sh\*t every holiday, I want to be happy. I know I wont get this staying in my hometown my whole life.

I know I did not give a lot of personal details, but what do you think? Were you confronted by family members for 'running away' or ruining anyone's relationships with your child?

Is it okay for me to be selfish right now or should I stay so my child can have a relationship with the same people who abused me?

I am in school and I'm trying to have a career in music but I find that I spend a lot of time watching tv and movies or playing video games and some times I get the feeling that I'm wasting my time by blasting my brain with mindless entertainment too much.  Also you can only spend so much time concentrating on music and school. I need to find other things to do at times.   


So what would you say would be a good use of down time? I don't know if I'm ready to do volunteer work even though I should. I had done some volunteer work in high school with elderly people and they complained because I was depressing. So is there some sort of medium between wasting time watching tv and volunteering to help people in need? I feel like the answer would be to get a part time job and maybe that would be a good idea. So besides tv, video games, volunteering or employment what could I do that would be meaningful? Just crowd sourcing for some possible options.",smith_and_jones4ever,5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/1288oc9/i_want_to_do_something_meaningful_with_my_life/,lot responsibility school trying career music find spend lot time watching tv movie playing video game time get feeling wasting time blasting brain mindless entertainment much also spend much time concentrating music school need find thing time would say would good use time know ready volunteer work even though done volunteer work high school elderly people complained wa depressing sort medium wasting time watching tv volunteering help people need feel like answer would get part time job maybe would good idea besides tv video game volunteering employment could would meaningful crowd sourcing possible option,want something meaningful life found meaningful way pas time,smith jones 4 ever
My mind just got blown by finally reading the name of something instead of hearing about it.,"Soooo in my language we have this stuff called ""Tinner""(pronounced teen-er), it is famous for it famous smell, and for been a jack of all trades substance. You just know walking in somewhere that someone make a change into the room (patching a wall, refurbishing furniture, cleanned a mess that normal cleaners couldn't clean, plumbing, etc) because of the smell.

All I know is that it smells hard and handimen use it for everything. In all of my life I've never used the stuff or seen where the substance in its packaging.

So Anyway.

Today I was looking to do some DIY work on dyes, and after many fails with other substances, all tutorials I see are in english since there are greater sharing channels. One tutorial suggested using Paint ""Thinner"", I first need to do a small sample so I look in my arts and crafts drawer and look for one. All I find is an ""Acrilic Solvent"" (basically a 1 to 1 translation of Paint Thinner), and think nothing of it. 

Before doing the sample I research how expensive this is going to be for a big project, and see that I need 5L of the stuff, the bottle Im currently using is 150ml and is around 3USD. But hopefully a larger bucket will be cheaper. 


While looking for the Solvent on between all the ""Solvent"" buckets I see a ""Thinner"" bucket. I carefully click on the ad listing cause I don't want to import it, (in which this ad actually was).

Somehow I feel my neurons creating a path between ""Thinner"" and ""Tinner"". Had to double check with someone in the room, and called me dumb(affectionate).

So Thinner is the correct orthography of the word, but since we always pronounced stuff as it is written I never made the connection between the two.

I now found a 5L bucket that is 2USD 👍",Gemela12,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/128fxzc/my_mind_just_got_blown_by_finally_reading_the/,soooo language stuff called tinner pronounced teen er famous famous smell jack trade substance know walking somewhere someone make change room patching wall refurbishing furniture cleanned mess normal cleaner clean plumbing etc smell know smell hard handimen use everything life never used stuff seen substance packaging anyway today wa looking diy work dye many fails substance tutorial see english since greater sharing channel one tutorial suggested using paint thinner first need small sample look art craft drawer look one find acrilic solvent basically 1 1 translation paint thinner think nothing sample research expensive going big project see need 5l stuff bottle im currently using 150ml around 3usd hopefully larger bucket cheaper looking solvent solvent bucket see thinner bucket carefully click ad listing cause want import ad actually wa somehow feel neuron creating path thinner tinner double check someone room called dumb affectionate thinner correct orthography word since always pronounced stuff written never made connection two found 5l bucket 2usd,mind got blown finally reading name something instead hearing,gem ela 12

Or when you listen to someone sing, you know when they're good or not, but when you do it yourself, it's not that easy.

pulling an allnighter to study for my midterm tomorrow.

i let these questions plague my thoughts, questions unanswerable, or maybe even questions that i already had the answers to. i was just about to give up on studying and just take the L on my midterm, but decided instead to go on a run, 4am in the morning.

what a fucking trap those thoughts are hey?

look at the stars, aren't they beautiful?

look at that tree, it's fucking PINK!!! it's the only plant within a 5km radius of me that is fucking PINK! like WHAT?

I can hear my heartbeat, it's pushing this liquid that's making this whole weird organism function, this organism that has millions of independent functions - so many that if you were to associate all the tasks in your body to people in this world, you would have to have atleast someone do more than one task.

Don't you see? There's so much in this world that's fucking insane. how could i let myself focus on the unanswerable, the bad, the miserable?

Look at what's happening around you NOW. Right fucking NOW. you'll find that it's all incredible.

I found my husband’s biological mother on Facebook,"Sorry for the long post but it’s kind of a long story.

My husband was born in the Philippines 26 years ago. His bio mom had a very hard life and my husband is actually her third child. She had her first child when she was 21 and the second when she was 23. The first two children were given to friends of hers because she was unable to care for or support a child financially. When she gave birth to my husband, she tried her hardest to care for him. She felt guilty with what she had done with her first two children even though she could still visit them. Because of the financial difficulties she ended up giving him to one of her friends who didn’t have any kids and her friend then gave my husband up for adoption without his mother’s consent. She tried very hard to get him back, but since she did not have the money or resources, she did not regain her parental rights. 

He was adopted by a very nice family in the United States. His adoptive family had one baby but after that became infertile so they decided to adopt. He had a great childhood with a loving family. He always knew he was adopted but they never made him feel like he wasn’t a true part of their family.

Earlier this year my husband showed me the packet that the adoption company made for him which included pictures of his bio mom and her name so I decided to search for her online and I found her. I told him and he seemed surprised that I found her and told me to wait to do anything. We talked about how to approach the situation because he wanted to be sensitive towards his adoptive mom’s feelings because she was the mom that raised him and he didn’t know how she might feel but he wanted to let his biological mother know that he was okay and that he has a happy life. We have our own daughter together and as a mother I couldn’t imagine not seeing my baby ever again or never knowing what happened to her. We talked to his adoptive family and they were 100 percent okay with it and encouraged him to reach out so we did. 

It was a very emotional first conversation. We video chatted with them and they cried upon seeing each other for the first time in 26 years. She doesn’t speak a lot of English so we have to have someone else translate it or use Google translate. She had three more children after my husband who all live with her and she got married. She is very happy to be a grandmother and to have her son back in her life. We hope one day we can go to the Philippines to meet them and so they can reunite in person. We even started a fundraiser and made a plan for saving money so hopefully in a year or so we can go!

TL;DR: my husband was put up for adoption in the Philippines and got adopted by a family in the United States. I searched his biological mother’s name online and found her and they started talking.

I can't ever see the character; I only see the actor,"Just saw John Wick 4, and felt the need to mention this.

Have racecar pit crews ever gone on to a life of crime?,"I've seen claims that in certain US cities (cough cough Detroit) it's not uncommon for vehicles to be completely stripped and left on blocks in as little as 30 minutes.

Why do we emphasize being able to work in groups when dealing with professions?,"I work tons better alone and so would most people. Not having coworkers around means you can stay focused and knock out what you need. I'm just tired of every job wanting to emphasis being group orientated. Yeah, most humans can socialize enough to work on a group project when needed. In every job I've had I am less effecient when I have someone in conversation range. I can work and talk easily, but having music or something on is way easier to zone in.

Even more, I find group dedicated jobs allow others to slack off because projects have deadlines and someone will pick up the work so the group doesn't fail as a whole.

People say I'm being annoying when I overly explain what I'm doing but I've found it's necessary,"So it seems like whenever I do anything, people seem to be puzzled. I'm a bit scatterbrained and I have my own system for how to order my tasks, so from the outside looking in, it seems like I'm wandering aimlessly, putting things in the wrong places, or not doing anything at all, but there is absolutely a method to the madness.

My problem is how people react to it. They'll ask me what I'm doing and I'll give short answers like ""I'm putting X away,"" but those short answers aren't ever good enough because they always ask follow-up questions or make remarks like ""but X doesn't go there, why did you ever think it went there?"" So I'll have to say something like ""well, the spot where it goes is occupied so I have to take Y out first and do some rearranging before I put X in its correct spot."" It's gotten bad too, like I've had bosses who would get really mad, like ""Why are you putting X in the wrong spot, what's your problem, what's wrong with you?!?!"" So I've had to quickly explain my actions to keep them from jumping down my throat.

Because of all this, I've developed a habit of explaining everything I do in full detail and omitting nothing whenever someone asks what I'm doing with that tone. So I don't overly explain when people are just like ""sup, whatcha doin?"" But if they genuinely act puzzled by my actions I feel compelled to explain it all. But people have said this is annoying (I've been compared to Rick Moranis in Ghostbusters talking about turning his TV on in his apartment and why he invited clients to his party), but I get annoyed at their responses if I don't do it.

I'll try to keep this short

About a year ago we reconnected on Instagram after 8 or so years (my family moved across the state) and have been talking off and on ever since, maybe a couple times a month, just keeping in touch. 
Then about a month ago she came to town for sports and we met up a few times and hung out a bit. I managed to get her number and since then we've been talking everyday, when we're not busy, quite a lot. We tend to stay up late (the other night we were up till 4) and will talk about pretty much anything. 
I really like her and I'm pretty certain she likes me too (based off what I just told you above) so I wanna tell her to hopefully move forward with something, but I don't know when I should. 
It's only been a month that we've really been talking so I feel like that could be too soon, but I don't wanna wait too long and have her ""lose hope"" so to speak and move on, you know?

Being proactive in conversations,"In most social gatherings I'm mostly quiet and listen to the conversation. If I have something to say about that, I may say a sentence or two,  maybe even a question. If I see an opportunity for a transition to a topic I'll enjoy I'll take it and maybe be a bit more active in the conversation. 

Waiting for opportunities is reactive and I'd like to be more proactive, but I find this extremely difficult, especially with people I don't already have a connection with.

Last year, friend 1 introduced me to his childhood friend, friend 2, and we clicked instantly. It’s like the three of us knew each other for years. Throughout the past year, we’ve hung out a shit ton.

About 10 months ago, friend 3 started hanging out with us more. The more time friend 3 spent with us, the more I got to know him and the more I realize I do not like him as a person.

Friend 3 is a great guy, don’t get me wrong. But our personalities definitely do not mesh, and the more I interact with him the more I begin to despise him and become annoyed with him.

Honestly, I have no issues with telling friend 3 that I don’t want to be around him anymore. But, I haven’t said anything because my bond with friend 1 and 2 is stronger than my dislike for friend 3. And I also don’t want to make things weird for the group.

I think I'm getting rid of my cell phone...,"This morning I woke up to my cell phone not charging. It's officially broken. I'm overseas so a warranty replacement is likely going to be a weeks long hassle.

Spending the day without a cell phone (and considering the weeks I might have to) made me feel things I haven't felt in a long time. A sense of freedom. Less anxiety. The inability to take out a little screen in moments of boredom or awkwardness. Generally, a greater connection with the world around me. Like blinders got taken off.

I've wanted to get rid of my phone for a while, but it always felt so impossible, so impractical. Yet, going through the motions of securing a replacement phone, being in touch with work, talking to friends, all without a phone and only via my computer when I had wifi felt like something that was doable today. And maybe tomorrow, and the next day.

I'll consider getting a very simple talk/text only phone, mostly for work, but I think I'm doing this, I think I'm canning my cell phone.

For a long time I've had the feeling that my cell phone has been the source of stress, anxiety, depression, isolation, loads of wasted time, loss of potential... the list goes on.

Has anyone on here done this sort of thing? Any suggestions? Convince me not to do it if you like. Just want to hear what people think.",vschiller,63,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/126inc3/i_think_im_getting_rid_of_my_cell_phone/,morning woke cell phone charging officially broken overseas warranty replacement likely going week long hassle spending day without cell phone considering week might made feel thing felt long time sense freedom le anxiety inability take little screen moment boredom awkwardness generally greater connection world around like blinder got taken wanted get rid phone always felt impossible impractical yet going motion securing replacement phone touch work talking friend without phone via computer wifi felt like something wa doable today maybe tomorrow next day consider getting simple talk text phone mostly work think think canning cell phone long time feeling cell phone ha source stress anxiety depression isolation load wasted time loss potential list go ha anyone done sort thing suggestion convince like want hear people think,think getting rid cell phone,v schiller
What’s your favourite Netflix series/show that was cancelled way too soon?,"I’ll go first. 
Santa Clarita Diet. 
That show was perfectly hilarious, witty, fun.

What's your favorite comfort food?,"It's been a long week and all I want to do is curl up with some blanket, a whole box of 4-cheese or pepperoni pizza beside me while watching any series on Netflix. 

I'm curious what type of food y'all are going for to feel better, would you prefer one that you can just order online (like me) , something you can prep quickly (e.g microwave) or would it be something you cook or bake for a few minutes/hours.

"Today a friend stopped by to give me a gift, and it filled my heart with such love that I felt the need to pass on the kindness...","...so I went and bought a simple bouquet of flowers and gave them out to random people on the street! My favorite was a dude who was just sitting on the side of the road looking at his phone, receiving a flower from a random girl was probably the very last thing he expected to happen because he had to ask me what I said after the first time I offered it to him, then he accepted it with a smile :)

I love McDonad's!,"Let me tell you something else, folks. As much as I like to talk about the problems with college institutions these days, there's one thing that always puts a smile on my face - McDonald's! That's right, I love me some Mickey D's, and I'm not afraid to admit it.

There's just something about that golden arches logo that gets me every time. Maybe it's the taste of those crispy fries, or the juicy burgers that always hit the spot. Whatever it is, I can't get enough of it.

Now, I know some people might say that McDonald's isn't the healthiest option out there, but let me tell you, sometimes you just need a little indulgence in your life. And when I'm feeling like a treat, there's nothing better than a trip to McDonald's.

So yeah, I might have my issues with colleges and the way they're turning out graduates these days. But when it comes to McDonald's, I'm a loyal fan for life. Give me a Big Mac and some fries any day, and I'm a happy man.",DaddyCeiling,42,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/1271ocr/i_love_mcdonads/,let tell something else folk much like talk problem college institution day one thing always put smile face mcdonald right love mickey afraid admit something golden arch logo get every time maybe taste crispy fry juicy burger always hit spot whatever get enough know people might say mcdonald healthiest option let tell sometimes need little indulgence life feeling like treat nothing better trip mcdonald yeah might issue college way turning graduate day come mcdonald loyal fan life give big mac fry day happy man,love mcdonad,daddy ceiling
