I keep trying to force tears just to feel something ( as dramatic as it sounds ) , but nothing happens, I can never cry naturally , I have to force myself , and the minute I stop focusing on it , the tears dry up oops  . I feel isolated from everyone - like I can see my family / friends interacting but there’s like this chain keeping me rooted in place if that makes sense ? All communication is too much effort ? Let alone movement . The feeling of nothingness is almost safer and more comfortable and reliable ? I kinda prefer it than being happy I guess . Happy makes me feel vulnerable or uncomfortable . Everything good and bad in life comes from feelings .\n"
