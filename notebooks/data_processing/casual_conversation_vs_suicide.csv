&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;m at a healthy weight, but I noticed something: there is a HUGE difference in how I&amp;#39;m treated by random people if I&amp;#39;m just 1-2 kg slimmer than my current weight. Right now I&amp;#39;m healthy looking with a not exactly flat belly, but the margin is bery small and the difference is night and day. If I&amp;#39;d lose the 2 kilos of weight, I know I&amp;#39;d get passersby looking at me more, I&amp;#39;d get more attention from store clerks and so on, because it&amp;#39;s happened so many times already!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since people flock to those they find attractive (I know I do), the superpower I then possess is the ability to brighten up their days a little bit. When I get more attention I always try to sneak in some little compliment into the random encounters! If they consider me attractive, I&amp;#39;ll use the opportunity to throw some kindness back at them hoping it will make them feel a bit better about themseves. Hopefully a little kindness can go a long away and change people&amp;#39;s negative views of others perceive them.&lt;/p&gt;

So they&amp;#39;re not equal, but hey, at least I made some good effort. And now this year, I passed both my theater and Music Appreciation class. It&amp;#39;s safe to say that I pretty much did it despite sleeping off again. Granted, this is the last chance to pass my courses or I won&amp;#39;t go to college anymore, but at least things are turning around now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My parents are proud of me that I finally passed my two courses and I&amp;#39;m glad that I improved. I hope I keep making straight A&amp;#39;s and/or B&amp;#39;s in my further classes because I know that I&amp;#39;m a smart person. I need to work hard so I could transfer to a big university my parents had thought of me going to where I can pursue my career.&lt;/p&gt;

Tuesday morning I had woken up late and was in a rush to get to a doctor's appointment. When I arrived in the lobby, there was only one elevator available, and the doors were about to close. So I held the door and jumped in.

Suddenly, a squealing roar emitted from the left corner of the elevator, akin to the sound of a 180 HPE motor launching out on choppy waters. This  little lady was packing canned heat, and she had just let it rip!

I was so shocked, all I said was thank you very sheepishly. I hope he at least heard me. To this day I’m thankful for his compliment, and the fact he took the time out of his day to say that to me. I admire people who can be so sweet with no want or expectation of anything in return. 
I hope to spread positivity to others more often, and be more like that man that shared his kindness with me.

Such a simple act of kindness, but I’ve never had someone do something like this for me ever.
I was so shocked, all I said was thank you very sheepishly. I hope he at least heard me. To this day I’m thankful for his compliment, and the fact he took the time out of his day to say that to me. I admire people who can be so sweet with no want or expectation of anything in return. 
I hope to spread positivity to others more often, and be more like that man that shared his kindness with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: added TLDR. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: I received a compliment years ago that still brightens my day even now, and motivates me to create the same positivity in other peoples lives!&lt;/p&gt;

So far, it's pretty good, it has a good scale in difficulty, It has a lot of cool mechanics that I wish GTA 5 had. The campaign for GTA 4 so far I've gotten up to the ""Love is not lost"" mission so I haven't seen all of the campaign  but so far, I think it's really good, I enjoy the main character of Niko. He's in entertaining main character without being a generic gangster type

A lot of the mechanics I enjoyed that aren't in GTA 5 is I enjoy the fact, your health doesn't automatically re heel, you have to go to a restaurant and get food to heal, I understand some people might find that annoying which I understand, but I enjoy it.

and the game has a lot of details that GTA 5 doesn't have like, for example, when you're in a cop car, you can look up criminals, and I just think that's a really cool detail

But so far I've enjoyed it 8.5/10 so far

,CasualConversation,"
I'm a 6 foot male in my early thirties, and I've been overweight since I was about 12 years old. 

It all started back when I started secondary school. I wasn't a very confident kid and going to ""big school"" didn't go down well... Combine using food as a way to feel ""better"", with a fear of exercise through lack of confidence, I ended up a bit of a chubby kid. Not huge... just chubby. 

Fast forward a few years, and once I hit university I started getting bigger. Nights out every weekend consuming a frightening amount of calories in alcohol and end-of-night stodge; eating and snacking out more now that I'm earning a weekend job wage; it all added up, and by my early 20's I was over 20 stone (280lb). 

Late twenties I peaked at about 22 stone (308lb). Looking at photographs back then, I really did look unhealthily fat. I almost look like a different person. I think seeing that has helped me not go back there, but I'm stuck at about 20 stone now and have been for a while.

Last year I got down to about 18.5 stone - the lowest I'd been for over 10 years probably. And I felt great. I was proud of myself, I looked better, and I generally felt better day-to-day. And the best thing was that I was doing it gradually through simple daily changes that I enjoyed... I was snacking less; eating smaller portions, tracking my eating, and exercising by walking each day for a minimum of 30 minutes.  

Unfortunately, last summer I had a bit of a ""health episode"" (unrelated to weight) which saw me in hospital for a couple of weeks. That really did knock me back. The good routines that I'd gotten into had gone, and I just didn't have the willpower in me for months that followed. 

I'm getting ""back on it"" again now. In recent weeks I've been doing a little more exercise between work  and parenting, and I've been eating healthier again too. My biggest issue at the moment is snacking! Especially in the evening when we're chilling together in front of the TV. It's a bad habit that I need to get out of, but I'll get there. 

Anyway, as of 30 minutes ago, my weight is 20 stone 4 (284lb). My goals are: 

* By the end of July before I go on holiday, I want to be 19 stone (266lb). That gives me just over 11 weeks to lose 18lbs. Just over 1.5lb a week. I think that's achievable!
* By the end of the year I want to be 17 stone (238lb). That works out at about 1lb a week. I think that is very achievable, and I'm hoping to exceed that!

I've never spoken about weight loss with friends and family before. In all honesty, I'm embarrassed about it and kind of feel ashamed. Hence the anonymous Reddit profile as a way of ""talking"" to people for the first time. I'm hoping this approach works and helps me. In the past, the only person I've spoken to about weight loss and my goals is myself in my own head!

So why am I doing it?

* I'm just fed up of falling into the overweight category. 
* I want to feel better. I don't know what it feels like to not be overweight. 
* I don't regret anything because I have a great life, but I know that there are many opportunities that I've missed out on over the years due to my weight and due to its impact on my confidence. I want to stop missing out on those opportunities. 
* I want to look better. And fit more comfortably into clothing. 
* I want to be more confident in myself. I think being overweight sometimes keeps me back in generally interacting with people, in some aspects at work, and so on...
* There are many other reasons that pop into my head from time-to-time too. 

How am I going to do it?

* Smaller portions at mealtimes. 
* Healthier meals. (We generally eat healthily for the most part anyway at home, so just increasing that more.)
* Reduction in snacks! (I need to get out of this bad habit in the evenings!!!)
* Walking daily. 
* General increase in physical activity throughout the home. (Exercise bike; dumbbells)

I guess you guys don't really need to know all this. I've never ""spoken"" about it before (I know, I'm not actually speaking here...), but being able to get this down on virtual paper I'm hoping will help with my motivation and willpower. Ultimately, enough is enough now and I'm ready...

If anybody got this far and has any advice or words of encouragement, or any personal accounts on what has worked (or is currently working) for you, then go for it!

Thanks people of Reddit!

&lt;p&gt;I graduated from a wheelchair to crutches this weekend, after 90 days stuck in my apartment!! I can drive around, now that I can crutch to the car (my bad knee is the left, so it just chills in the fancy massive brace.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sitting at the beach, in my car, windows down, chill music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can I do from the drivers seat?&lt;/strong&gt; I am NOT ready to get out of the car -  my knee has more healing to do, and I’m still paranoid AF. &lt;em&gt;11% of people with my injury, automatic amputation; 86% of people with this injury who don’t receive full/successful treatment from an orthopedic team, amputation&lt;/em&gt; I am lucky AF. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideas already on my mind: 
- Drive somewhere scenic and park
- Take long drives somewhere scenic/explore neighborhoods/areas via car 
- Drive in movie theaters&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideas?&lt;/p&gt;

So I was out today with my grandfather's car, went to the grocery store and I got into the parking lot but I accidentally went the wrong entry (I was at the exit way), anyway I'm trying to back off scared shitless I'm gonna hit someone on the back, and this guy comes towards me with a big truck just bursting out yelling and doing hand motion, and in my mind I'm like ""oh he means come forward because maybe I'll fit"" and lo and behold I just went straight into a freaking car parked there. I just became a mess and I couldn't even get my car out of the  way and had to call my granddad to help me out, luckily the guy didn't ask for much money and didn't want to get the police involved since it was a little scratch, but my granddad's car is fucked the part near the light is cracked and kind of busted out of place, I currently don't have the money to get it fixed since I just gave it all I had saved to the guy whose car I bumped, and my grandad absolutely doesn't want to except money from me, since I'm still a uni student and don't have a proper job.

We hung out for almost 6 hours! It was so nice. We were then hanging out in his car while I waited for my bus and started holding hands. 

He asked if he could kiss me, and I told him I had never kissed anyone before and I was nervous. He was so so nice and said we didn’t have to kiss if I Didn’t want to. But I really really wanted to. I told him that I wanted to but wasn’t sure how, so he gave me one kiss and it was very sweet and soft.

Then we were listening to music (had about 30min til my bus came) and I laid my head on his shoulder. We were kissing on and off the whole time. It was so so so nice.

Then I left the car when the bus was about to arrive and he gave me a kiss goodbye.

I haven’t stopped thinking about it!!!!! This is almost 8 hours ago now. I cannot stop thinking about it!!! Kissing is so so so nice and idk how I’ve gone so long without doing so. It made me feel so cared about? I know I don’t need to get kissed to feel loved and wanted, but having someone wanna do that with me felt so special. And I am so distracted now because all I want is to kiss him again and again and again. I want to hold his hand and sleep on his shoulder. Aaaaaa!!!!!!!! I don’t think I’ve ever actually felt attracted to anyone before, and this is all so new to me and kinda scary because I feel like I am being obsessive!!!!

,CasualConversation,"I hired a guy into our small business 6 months ago. There are only 3 of us as its a small operation. He was originally from Senegal but has lived in the UK for 13 years. My workmate is an older English bloke and from the get go he wasn't very matey with the new guy. There's not really a language barrier but I feel like hes somehow created one by not adjusting the way he communicates with the guy knowing his first language wasn't English.

I on the other hand have communicated with him without any issue. I have learned so much about this guys life and I'm so glad I've taken the time to speak with him. He has written speeches for the current president of Senegal, he knows the past and current police commissioner, he has survived through genocides, he has protected the weak and killed aggressors. This guy is quiet and so kind but there is so much more to his life than you would know if you don't engage. 

He was a top mathematician until one day he decided he had peaked and went after somthing else. He has clip online of a maths competition where his students won and one of the dads came on to camera and told the story of how he brought his child into school from working on a farm, paid for his lessons and took him to the competition. When they won the father told the interviewer that he has not seen God but he believes (my guy) must be him. Aparently upon hearing that he quit teaching from that day. I asked him why and all he said was ""when you are compared to God how can you ever achieve more in that place?"" 

He moved onto graphic design teaching himself. Then started teaching others it in a school. Finally he came over here and bounced around alot until he landed with me.

There are only 3 of us as its a small operation. He was originally from Senegal but has lived in the UK for 13 years. My workmate is an older English bloke and from the get go he wasn&amp;#39;t very matey with the new guy. There&amp;#39;s not really a language barrier but I feel like hes somehow created one by not adjusting the way he communicates with the guy knowing his first language wasn&amp;#39;t English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I on the other hand have communicated with him without any issue. I have learned so much about this guys life and I&amp;#39;m so glad I&amp;#39;ve taken the time to speak with him. He has written speeches for the current president of Senegal, he knows the past and current police commissioner, he has survived through genocides, he has protected the weak and killed aggressors. This guy is quiet and so kind but there is so much more to his life than you would know if you don&amp;#39;t engage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was a top mathematician until one day he decided he had peaked and went after somthing else. He has clip online of a maths competition where his students won and one of the dads came on to camera and told the story of how he brought his child into school from working on a farm, paid for his lessons and took him to the competition. When they won the father told the interviewer that he has not seen God but he believes (my guy) must be him. Aparently upon hearing that he quit teaching from that day. I asked him why and all he said was &amp;quot;when you are compared to God how can you ever achieve more in that place?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He moved onto graphic design teaching himself. Then started teaching others it in a school. Finally he came over here and bounced around alot until he landed with me. &lt;/p&gt;

,CasualConversation,"hey there, r/casualconversation!  
im a freshman in hs, and I thought it might be fun to share what my typical day looks like. I've always loved reading about other people's routines, and I thought it might be interesting to share mine!  
1st thing is vball practice, its kind of super intense, but I love it. The feeling of the ball hitting my hand and flying over the net, the adrenaline rush when we score a point - it's the best way to kickstart my day + my teammates are fantastic. weve developed a bond that feels more like a sisterhood than just being part of a team.  
after school and practice, if the weather's nice, I usually head over to the local pool with some friends. There's nothing like diving into cool water after a long day of classes and volleyball. It's a great way to unwind and have some fun. and it's also an excellent opportunity for me to work on my tan (with plenty of sunscreens, of course!).  
then, it's off to the mall! I'm a bit of a shopaholic, I must admit. there's something so satisfying about finding that perfect outfit or stumbling upon a fantastic sale. my friends and I could spend hours trying on clothes, and we often do. It's a great way to relax and just enjoy our time.

  
to end the day, I like to unwind with a bit of Netflix or maybe do some journaling. it's nice to have some time to myself to reflect on my day and prepare for the next one.  
So, that's pretty much a day in my life! I'd love to hear about what your days look like. Do you have any routines or rituals? Any favorite ways to unwind after a long day? Looking forward to hearing from you!

,CasualConversation,"So I've recently decided to start writing a book. It's very complicated and to long to explain right now, however I need some ideas for some abilities for the characters in the book.

The way the power system works is that according to your zodiac animal, if you train hard enough you will be granted certain abilities.

I have some down right now for example:

Ox: Triple strength of human, speed of an ox, however stamina is low, after one charge or 30 minutes of labour you require rest. 

Rooster: Can hop/glide for short distances, hollow bones to reduce weight however due to hollow bones, fracturing/breaking them is a higher risk. Loud screech ability that deafens anyone in a 10 meter radius, can only be used once per hour due to negative impact on throat.

The only real rule is that it has to have some sort of weakness in order to not make it over powered but also not under powered.

&lt;p&gt;Rooster: Can hop/glide for short distances, hollow bones to reduce weight however due to hollow bones, fracturing/breaking them is a higher risk. Loud screech ability that deafens anyone in a 10 meter radius, can only be used once per hour due to negative impact on throat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only real rule is that it has to have some sort of weakness in order to not make it over powered but also not under powered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

I just accepted a job offer today and will be starting my first day on the upcoming Monday. This is going to be my first corporate (office) job in my life and also the first that I will be paid a salary as opposed to hourly wages. Honestly, I am anxious about many things;from losing the freedom that I previously had as now I will be working in the box at a desk for 8 hrs a day doing repetitive tasks (my new company is a law firm) unlike what I was doing before (I was a teacher/tutor at a daycare/after school center, so I had a pretty flexible schedule and multiple engaging activities).

Honestly, I just feel like letting it out. I already talked to people in my close circle and they assured me that I will be fine.

1. The food is always on time, it's not cold by the time it is delivered unless I'm ordering something on the other side of the city. 
2. They have excellent map system, and the deliverers call me only once, i.e., when they are at my apartment to let me know that they are at the location, so that I can come down and pick it up. 
3. They don't charge more me absurd prices. The price at the restaurants is exactly the same on those apps. The extra charges like delivery charges are nominal. They are not absurd and the pricing on them seem fair. If I am interested, I can tip and I always do that too, but it is not forced and you don't have to go through 100 different pages to click on no tip. It goes 100% to the deliverer.
4. The food is packaged really well and the brown paper bags are neatly closed with cellophane tape with the logo of the delivery app. So, it's not the deliverer's fault that something is missing.
5. The customer service is excellent. If the restaurant misses anything, which by the way is extremely rare (has happened only 2 times in 3-4 years), you can call/text the delivery app's customer care, send them photo of what you received and tell them what is missing, and within 10 minutes, a new order for the missing item would be placed with no extra charge, or you can get a refund too if you don't want it.
6. They have 3 apps; one of the customers, one for the restaurants, one for the deliverers. It works well for all. Restaurants can change the menus based on time, and can even recommend you things which they think is good. Also, restaurants have the choice of partnering up with these apps. No restaurant can be forced to join and no deliverer is expected to order it themselves over there, pick it up and deliver. They notify a deliverer when it is time to pick up from the restaurant so that they don't linger around it. Restaurants can reject a particular order too.
7. Fast food chains like KFC, Popeye's, Domino's, etc., which traditionally have their own delivery system have also picked up. They have their own apps. I can order in ease, and they follow all do all the above things mentioned.

,CasualConversation,"Screwed up big time when we first brought a new 2 year old cat to our house and brought her to our room however did not realize our resident cat - 6 year old was under the bed (very rarely does he go under the bed therefore we didn't check - but nonetheless it's still definitely my fault for not checking). So I only noticed when I noticed our new cat was staring under the bed and being very still. Looked under and there was our resident cat, staring back intensely 😭 Carried him up and out of the room but it was too late, he started hissing at her 😭

The next few days we constantly shared each other furs to both. Continue giving the same love to our resident cat but he upon a few days in, he started to hiss at me. Sigh. Gave him his favourite treats but once finished, he goes and hides away. So I gave him some time to calm himself while still continuing to transfer stuff of the new cat to him and vice versa. 

I know it takes time, it's been 2 weeks since and at times he still hisses at me (I now wash my hands to erase the new cat smell before touching him) or hides away (preventing me to play/pet with him). 

Also have started letting both of them switch places to smell each other scents in their allocated rooms but so far I do not see much improvement :(

I just hope, even if it takes some time, they can be friends or just be casual acquaintance at least. 

Initially thought it wouldn't be that hard or at least wouldnt get hissed as often as they both have the same habits and all but I guess cats are very territorial and maybe we have spoiled our resident cat? 

But I guess 1 good thing is, my new cat is now very comfy at home although probably due to this, our resident cat feels threatened and therefore is angry at me for thinking I'm planning to replace him?

They said they’d remove the cast, then I could go home. That’s it.

,CasualConversation,"Hello everyone! This is going to be all over the place, so sorry in advance. TLDR at bottom!

I’ve been at my current job for almost 4 years now. I started out per diem for the weekends, but quickly started working full time hours. I also cross-trained into a different modality during this time. About a year later, the lead tech position became available and I received that job and also took on the role as the lead tech for two other modalities. I’ve been in my current role for almost 3 years. I’m a single mom and started going back to school in late 2021 for my bachelors. I take a new class every 5 weeks. 

Last year, my daughter ended up inpatient and we have been dealing with that for almost a year now. On top of my personal life, work kept adding more and more responsibilities to my role and I expressed that I was overwhelmed and starting to feel burnt out. The overwhelmed and burnt out feeling has been going on since January.

Nothing has changed and no pay raises have happened even though my responsibilities have increased. I had to make a new resume for one of my classes and post it to indeed. I have been receiving emails and calls for a month now offering jobs. 
One stood out and I decided to apply and check it out. I went into the interview thinking there was no way I would leave my current job because despite everything going on, I do love my boss and have always been loyal. 

They called me immediately after the interview was over and offered me the job paying $37 an hour I countered with wanting $42 and they just came back today with an offer of $40 and a sign on bonus! I couldn’t pass this up. It’s $5 more an hour than what I’m making now but zero management responsibilities. I will have a consistent M-F schedule with call every 10 weeks versus being on call every Friday and Saturday in my current role. I will gain more experience in the field that I currently do not have because it’s different types of exams. Also, no more overnights or evening shifts, and trying to scramble to find someone to pick up my daughter from after school care if I get stuck at work late. 

I’m getting my bachelors in business leadership and eventually, I do want to become manager, I’m just not mentally ready for that at this current moment. I’m scared to leave but excited for a new opportunity. I feel at peace with this decision and I feel like this will help my daughter a lot more with her mental health, as well as my own mental health.

so the lump did not hurt for a while, i’m assuming it was not infected yet. it started hurting about like 3/4 days ago, and gets worse everyday. at this point, it’s excruciating to make any type of movement. it’s red and hot, like radiating heat. and any little tiny touch to it feels like i’m getting stung by a thousand wasps. it’s kinda on my inner/under breast, and my breasts are big, so it’s constantly touching something.

,CasualConversation,"DISCLAIMER: AS SOON AS I FOUND OUT I TOLD ALL MY COWORKERS IMMEDIATELY, DON’T COME @ ME!

I work part time at a bar in my town alongside Uni. I was on £9.18 (minimum wage if you were 21, which I’m not) for the first six months I was there, then I heard from a coworker that we’re supposed to get raised to £9.50 after our probation period ends (3 months). 

That never happened, so I went to the head manager of the venue and asked him, which he complied with. 

A couple days later, minimum wage went up to £10.18 for 21 and above. I assumed that since I was already on 21 and above minimum wage before that, I’d get moved to the new rate, but I got moved to £9.88 instead. 

I went back to the head manager and he said that since I’m not 21 yet, I shouldn’t get moved to £10.18, but he’ll move me to £10.50 anyway since I’m doing a good job. 

I was ecstatic. That was huge. I went from £9.18 to £10.50 in the matter of a month just by asking twice. And he acknowledged that I did a good job. This was honestly such a great moment for me because I got fired from my last two part time positions, and it really hurt me mentally. I thought I was a shit worker. 

I haven’t been working as much since I got moved up because my exam season began, but when I got back, I got to talking with my coworkers and I realised, I’m the highest paid person on staff, minus the managers. 

There’s a gal here working full time for the last four years still on £10.42, while I’m on £10.50 eight months in. Absolutely incredible. 

I did let everyone else know asap once I realised though, because I thought it’s not fair. Imo, everyone works just as hard as I do, and they deserve to be compensated well. Everyone brings in a lot of sales, serves quickly and manages to keep a smile on their faces even on exhausting shifts. That’s not me just saying it though, my coworkers are genuinely wonderful, nearly all of them. 

One of my managers overheard me and said it’s not the best idea to discuss wages like this cuz it could backfire on me when everyone else goes and asks for a raise. The head manager could pretend it was an admin error and knock me back down to £9.88.

&lt;p&gt;I work part time at a bar in my town alongside Uni. I was on £9.18 (minimum wage if you were 21, which I’m not) for the first six months I was there, then I heard from a coworker that we’re supposed to get raised to £9.50 after our probation period ends (3 months). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That never happened, so I went to the head manager of the venue and asked him, which he complied with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple days later, minimum wage went up to £10.18 for 21 and above. I assumed that since I was already on 21 and above minimum wage before that, I’d get moved to the new rate, but I got moved to £9.88 instead. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went back to the head manager and he said that since I’m not 21 yet, I shouldn’t get moved to £10.18, but he’ll move me to £10.50 anyway since I’m doing a good job. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was ecstatic. That was huge. I went from £9.18 to £10.50 in the matter of a month just by asking twice. And he acknowledged that I did a good job. This was honestly such a great moment for me because I got fired from my last two part time positions, and it really hurt me mentally. I thought I was a shit worker. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t been working as much since I got moved up because my exam season began, but when I got back, I got to talking with my coworkers and I realised, I’m the highest paid person on staff, minus the managers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a gal here working full time for the last four years still on £10.42, while I’m on £10.50 eight months in. Absolutely incredible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did let everyone else know asap once I realised though, because I thought it’s not fair. Imo, everyone works just as hard as I do, and they deserve to be compensated well. Everyone brings in a lot of sales, serves quickly and manages to keep a smile on their faces even on exhausting shifts. That’s not me just saying it though, my coworkers are genuinely wonderful, nearly all of them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my managers overheard me and said it’s not the best idea to discuss wages like this cuz it could backfire on me when everyone else goes and asks for a raise. The head manager could pretend it was an admin error and knock me back down to £9.88. I doubt he’ll do that because I’m on his good side, and I’ve got a deputy manager covering my ass when things do get tense, but I am still a bit worried tho. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But overall yeah, I’m just kinda happy that within eight months, I became the highest paid person on staff. Feels great.&lt;/p&gt;

Also decades ago, if you have an average ability like PC document processing or hair designing, there&amp;#39;s also no worry about treating yourself with healthy food or silk clothing, but now, because of the competition and involution, if you don&amp;#39;t strive for better or more unique abilites than others, you&amp;#39;ll get poorer and poorer and even starve. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, for example, keeping a department of a company in order and competitive is way harder than learning to operate a textile mill. Human&amp;#39;s capability to learn more advanced things is not unlimited. &lt;/p&gt;

I am staying with a family friend. She is an old woman of about 74 years of age. 
This woman criticizes my character a lot. I am in vacation and I have been going out to avoid her because even though she is nice sometimes she tends to talk too much and I crave personal space after a long day of walking. I do spend dinner with her and talk to her and tell her about my life-big mistake. She has started to criticize in forms of “advice” my character. For instance that I am too lazy for sleeping in even during vacation, for not practicing Italian right now, for how much I spent during lunch (this was valid I did spend too much) because either way her food is better. 

There is no way for me to tell her that she is hurting my feelings because she can’t take criticism because she’s always right in her mind and it’s her duty to teach me things that she s
deems are appropriate without understanding the concept of individual differences and human limits. She criticizes my character and I defended myself by saying “my life journey is battling with my weaknesses with acceptance” which made her shut up for a second. 

Anyway the point of my rant was background context. I do think I need to understand her point of view, her advice might be unwarranted at times but in her mind she is trying to help me. I appreciate the good advice she had given me. I do think I need to find ways to cope with criticism and not believing in the negative things that are said about me which are not true. I am not lazy.

,CasualConversation,"I've been thinking about this problem a lot. I'm a 26m from London and find it really difficult to find anybody to do anything spontaneous with. I'm not referring to anything crazy, either – sometimes I just want to grab a drink with a friend or just an interesting person I might have something in common with.

I know the pandemic has made us all slightly more socially reclusive but I think lots of us are a increasingly lonely and internally frustrated (at the very least) by what our social experiences are turning into, especially given the way technology has changed our relationship with each other. We all now just stay at home on our phones and instead of being spontaneous, we sit there scrolling our lives away and comparing our real realities with other people's illusory realities.

,CasualConversation,"Keeping this all to myself and the few people I know IRL felt a little too boring or underwhelming for me, so I decided to share it with the most fitting subreddit to talk about it.

From 2013-2018, I usually preferred to stay up-to-date when it comes to selecting a video-game platform to play on, and if I wanted to play a video-game from the 1980s, 1990s, or 2000s, I usually just went for emulators and/or virtual-consoles.

However, starting in 2019 and even more true within' 2022, I suddenly gained a hunker to throw myself back to the past video-game generations for nostalgic reasons. It started with me going back to the GameCube, then the N64, and years ealier I already went back for the original GBA device, but as of today, I reverted into preferring to play GBA games on a Nintendo DS. Why? Well first off, I don't have enough friends or relatives who are interested enough to buy tools to play Multiplayer Games on the GBA (I just have potential for single-player modes only), and even then: Nintendo Switch Online has already/finally added the feature to officially emulate GBA games with Multiplayer, but lemme tell you: starting a few months ago, I finally got interested in going back to the DS generation because it has gotten so old that I now found it twice as nostalgic as I used to.

I decided to order a copy of the Original Nintendo DS (which already arrived btw, and luckily it works), because while Emulation and Virtual-Console is good, I still had the urge to use cartridges for both GBA and DS instead of just giving them away. I already owned a GameBoy Advance, so I was already capable of using the GBA Cartridges, while I already owned a 3DS, so I was also already capable of using DS Cartridges as well, but I still felt very fascinated by the fact that the Original DS supported cartridges for both GBA and DS, which I love because there are literally hundreds of different GBA games that correlate with existing DS games, and vice-versa. When I say correlate, it could mean three of the following things: 1. the same game released for multiple platforms, with GBA and DS being two of that game's actual existing versions, 2. the DS game is a direct sequel to the GBA game (or at least belongs to the same sub-series/saga), or 3. the DS game is somewhat based on the GBA game but it's debatable about whether it'd be a port, spinoff, or sequel.

Of course, not all matching GBA &amp; DS games actually have official connectivity, but that still doesn't stop me from wanting (and daring myself) to insert them both on a single DS just for fun to strengthen my fantasy in video-games &amp; their what-ifs.

,CasualConversation,"Soo this is not something that makes my life worse or anything. Its pretty much anecdotal, but still interesting enough to chat about it I think

Im very very sceptical with everything supernatural related, which is why I think its funny that Im scared of everything supernatural related heheh. Lemme give you to common scenarios for me:

Im in bed, about to snooze, my cat laying besides me under the bedsheets (shes very lovely), when she suddenly gets out and becomes tense. She stands on the bed, super steadily staring at my open door, at nothing. At leasg nothing I can see. Then she walks up to the door and stares at the hallway. BRUH whay are you SEEING!! Ik its nothing but it freaks me out.

Another one is I just watched/read/thought about some supernatural creepy spooky scary stuff, and I may have even laughed at it, but now Im terrified. My mind is conditioned to thinking the monster I watched in that creepypasta video is preying on me. Every step I take, my heart drops to my feet. Im tense, Im scared, yknow, fight or flight.

&lt;p&gt;Im very very sceptical with everything supernatural related, which is why I think its funny that Im scared of everything supernatural related heheh. Lemme give you to common scenarios for me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Im in bed, about to snooze, my cat laying besides me under the bedsheets (shes very lovely), when she suddenly gets out and becomes tense. She stands on the bed, super steadily staring at my open door, at nothing. At leasg nothing I can see. Then she walks up to the door and stares at the hallway. BRUH whay are you SEEING!! Ik its nothing but it freaks me out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another one is I just watched/read/thought about some supernatural creepy spooky scary stuff, and I may have even laughed at it, but now Im terrified. My mind is conditioned to thinking the monster I watched in that creepypasta video is preying on me. Every step I take, my heart drops to my feet. Im tense, Im scared, yknow, fight or flight. Sometimes I even end up taking a knife with me to feel safer. SAFER AGAINST SOMETHING I KNOW DOESNT EXIST AHHHH&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways yeah basically I keep this primal/childish fear of monsters in the dark, and its just funny. I sure would have a blast in one of those haunted houses...&lt;/p&gt;

Granted, one reason it's taken so long is because I spent the early part of my career doing global health in academia (which, surprise surprise, doesn't pay very well) (I also come from a poor family - I grew up on food stamps and was homeless for a period in my late teens), and don't get me wrong, I'm very grateful for the career I've had and the salaries I've made, but 1) being a doctor does not mean you're rich (and again, I'm not ungrateful for what I do have), and c) I by no means begrudge anyone who'd have their student loans forgiven for any reason, I'M JUST STOKED THAT I'M FINALLY FREE OF MY STUDENT LOANS!!!

&lt;p&gt;I love what I do and I&amp;#39;d do it all again in a heartbeat, but it&amp;#39;s been a grinding almost-two-decades-and-a-half trying to get these things paid off. Granted, one reason it&amp;#39;s taken so long is because I spent the early part of my career doing global health in academia (which, surprise surprise, doesn&amp;#39;t pay very well) (I also come from a poor family - I grew up on food stamps and was homeless for a period in my late teens), and don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, I&amp;#39;m very grateful for the career I&amp;#39;ve had and the salaries I&amp;#39;ve made, but 1) being a doctor does not mean you&amp;#39;re rich (and again, I&amp;#39;m not ungrateful for what I do have), and c) I by no means begrudge anyone who&amp;#39;d have their student loans forgiven for any reason, I&amp;#39;M JUST STOKED THAT I&amp;#39;M FINALLY FREE OF MY STUDENT LOANS!!!

We have a chihuahua/terrier mix and I call ours all sorts of things, like Mr. Stinko, Stinko Pop, Sir, Mr. Man, and recently just called him Mr. Propellerhead (because we joke that he’s actually an alien, and instead of brains in his head he has a little folded up propeller that will activate randomly one day when he’s ready to return to his intergalactic brethren, and then he’ll just levitate into the air/ascend into space leaving us all behind) 🤣

A few of the PhD students integrated me into their group and it has been a pleasure seeing some of them finish up and go on to do amazing things - it is also a very public/community focused program so very exciting in terms of giving back and helping others.

For some reason in the last 1-2 months the quality has been really bad. The coffee comes and the milk has been hardly frothed at all, it’s like it was just heated up.

By the time I get it it’s obviously too late to complain. Even though they’re an expensive cafe ($4.50) and also charge me extra for ordering decaf, I’d still feel bad being like ‘make my coffee again’ but at the same time I wish I could.

I asked myself, if I was the man fishing and that was my only source of food—would I truly want to live like that? This question came upon me from years of inner searching.

I figure the truck at 25000 the camper at 15000 and the pontoon at 15000 only comes to 55000 meaning if I put 25% of my check away starting in January it will take me just under 5 years to buy everything. I just don&amp;#39;t know if I want to wait that long although I know financially it&amp;#39;s the best strategy as they&amp;#39;re wants and not needs.&lt;/p&gt;

,CasualConversation,"So my puppy has a nightly ritual where he wants to be let out to pee at 3am. There’s a dog house along with food and water outside so we usually leave him out there until the morning. Well, this morning when he came back in his whole rear end was covered in blood. 

It was on his back legs, the side of his hind end, and all under his tail. My first thought was it looked like he was bleeding from his butt or pooping blood. I remembered my boyfriends parents telling us that he ate “quite a bit” of tin foil they had been grilling with about 2-3 days ago. Immediately I panicked. While we were on the way to the vet I started googling “what to do if dog ate tin foil,” “why is my dog bleeding from his butt,” “bowel obstruction dog symptoms,” “how much does veterinary bowel obstruction surgery cost.” By the time we were at the vet I was pouring tears and convinced that either my puppy was about to die or we were about to pay close to $10,000 to make sure he doesn’t. 

We got back there and filled out all the forms. They did a basic exam before getting him sedated and x-rayed. Those ten minutes after they sedated him scared me. The way my baby just laid his head in my lap and fell asleep. I just pet him and kissed him like it was the last time I was ever going to do it. The whole time he was back there I was shaking and intermittently crying. 

After about an hour the doctor comes in with a smile on her face. The first thing she told us was they found tin foil, but not enough to hurt him. The second thing she told us was that he was covered in paint. When they went to clean him off, the “blood” didn’t react like blood. It didn’t dissolve in peroxide and the towel was bright pink. So somehow this little fucker found paint inside our fenced in yard and sat in it, and I guess because it was raining I didn’t see the difference. The whole ordeal cost my boyfriend and I $1,300. It wasn’t totally for nothing as they did find parasites and gave us medicine and some vitamins. 

It wasn’t my idea to get a dog in the first place. I thought we didn’t have the space and this little shit is always getting into the trash and fighting with his brother (my cat), and I always thought I could take him or leave him. It wasn’t until today when I was confronted with the thought of him hurting or shit, losing him-my friend, my buddy-that I realized how much I really do love him. At the end of the day he’s my little shit and I would move heaven and earth for him. Do I feel like an idiot for how hard I panicked? A little.

I am just through with everything. I am deeply aware of how lazy that makes me sound. This is also the only line of work I am good at. So I am aware I cannot quit. I am aware I cannot escape this.

So I wiped it and installed Linux (CentOS) and it worked fine, for a while. Now some time ago, it wouldn't turn on any more, and I was very sad. Then just the other day, I dug it out of my closet, and lo and behold, the damn thing turns on again. I still had the password somewhere, and stumble across an old project in javascript and webassembly. So I did what any sane person would do and made a new project with the webassembly part isolated, so I could plug it into brain.js or tensorflow, and see if I can't come up with sane values for this calculation scattered across data structures.

I am 23 almost 24, and the past year of my life has simultaneously been the most eye opening, yet lonely, yet satisfying year of my life. 

First thing I realized was that college friends are not forever. What a farce that was. The second I lost interest in getting wasted at the same bars every weekend, it’s like I disappeared of the face of the earth to them. All because I grew up a little bit.  Sucks to be them to be honest. 

That goes for a lot of people. So many people I knew never grew past age 19 which is when I met them, and honestly I’m just glad I aged out of being an idiot and drunk degenerate. That shit is not cool and doesn’t help anyone in the long run.  I’d rather spend weekends alone than be surrounded by the fake and purposefully self-destructive “friends” I once had. 

Second thing is that I have already achieved a lot more inner harmony and satisfaction with my life than some people ever will.  

For example, this weekend I spent all weekend reading my books on the park, hopping around to random stores, and skateboarding at night time while I met a few interesting people.  All while I was alone. 

I feel like I’m one of the only people my age (that I know) that just go, do, and be.  I feel like a nomadic person while many others seem to have Stockholm syndrome and won’t go do anything alone or new. 

Third is I’m finally (finally) confident. Growing up I was always ashamed of my “weird” interests, especially because my mother always seemed embarrassed of them, even tho they were innocent and I wasn’t some crazy wild child.  Now that I don’t live with her, she really can’t tell me shit. I’m gonna go to the punk rock shows, get tattoos, hang out with who I want to, because I spent such a long time hiding my true passions from the world out of embarrassment.

People try to come up with these complex origin stories for themselves, for why they ""have"" to root for a team, but isn't it a bit ridiculous? How egotistical do you have to be to believe your entire life was centered around the story wherein you developed a passion for team A?

The building is probably 20-30 years old and so the construction is fairly good/no major issues. No surprise I might have spiders.

No joke he RAN for my couch to hide underneath. “I’m going to make it without being seen!” I know he knew he wasn’t supposed to be here….. 
I panic and grab a glass. I turn on all the lights so I can see him and move the end table and pull the couch out as fast as I can. He books it under the couch again! He totally knew what he was doing…. I push the couch back to the wall fast and finally he stays and freezes. I cover him. Anyone watching would have laughed but I was so frenzied. Not to run the vacuum at near midnight I dealt with him the next day. 

I treated outside the building again in the afternoon.

No joke he RAN for my couch to hide underneath. “I’m going to make it without being seen!” I know he knew he wasn’t supposed to be here….. 
I panic and grab a glass. I turn on all the lights so I can see him and move the end table and pull the couch out as fast as I can. He books it under the couch again! He totally knew what he was doing…. I push the couch back to the wall fast and finally he stays and freezes. I cover him. Anyone watching would have laughed but I was so frenzied. Not to run the vacuum at near midnight I dealt with him the next day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I treated outside the building again in the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, another spider, half dollar sized goes walking across the floor again! Third one in 5 days now? I clean, almost obsessively, so I’m just angry to where they keep coming from so now I’m researching products like earthkind “stay away” packs…. What are your stories? …. And solutions!! Happy Monday folks!&lt;/p&gt;

,CasualConversation,"I don't know if anyone else relates to this, but most of my creative ideas don't really begin as premises. Usually I just zone out, a single shot or frame will pop into my head, which I then spiral into an interesting premise. I enjoy this mostly because most to all of the ideas I get like this are really unique, and I can tell they'd be total bangers if I can flesh them out well enough.

Only problem is, because they're so random and vague, I often end up stuck with no guide as to how to progress further.

It sucks honestly; I'm sitting here with a solid premise, character dynamics, climax, thematic weight and everything. Everything except a goddamn *plot*.

Forgive my rant there I just needed to set this up for context.

My most recent brainwave was a shot where the character shoots the camera in a psychotic episode. I'd just finished a video regarding the psychology of fourth wall breaking, and from there my cogs started turning.

What if there was a TV show about the character realizing that he was in a TV show?

It would be interesting, for sure, and definitely something I would watch if it already existed. It'd definitely be psychological thriller, no less than TV-14, but I think the real kicker would be the double layer of psychosis. To all the other characters in the world, the protagonist would be going borderline insane. I mean, if your friend started came up to you with a loaded gun and started ranting about how all of us exist in a work of fiction, you'd be pretty damn disturbed too. It could be fun if the showrunners could also subtly tease the audience by hinting that the protagonist may just be hallucinating and may not actually be self-aware.

It could also be a fresh take on media's depiction of existentialism. *Everything Everywhere* just snowplowed the entire industry with an equally compelling take on the matter, and I think this premise could do something similar. If you exist solely to fulfill the role cast onto you by a higher power, how much of your life is really yours?

Odd but mistakes happen. The employees wear red vests with the store name on the back and front, along with name tags so you'd think it would be obvious I wasn't an employee, but hey. 

They didn't have the plant, so I decided to get something else. I'm standing there, looking up cat safety of different plants on my phone and two more older people approach me. One took it well and moved on. The other struggled a bit.  

""Where are the [...]?""

""Are you sure?"" 

""I'm just here to buy a plant. I'm looking up plants on my phone"" 

_holds up phone and plant_  

_long pause_ 

""....ok...""

I finally picked a plant and headed to the checkout, and had to explain twice more on the way I didn't work there. At this point I am so done. I'm an anxious person and my social battery was already empty. I wanted a plant and this was the first I'd left my house in days because I am an anxious person and my social battery was empty and has been. 

And so of course there's no cashiers and it's a clearance plant which needs an employee to do the discount. So much for a quick escape. Off to find someone who actually works there.

""Oh, hey, hey where are the [...]!!??"" 

""I don't work here"" 

I'm not even trying to be nice at this point. Just leave me alone. 

I find an employee, distinguishable from customers by her red vest that says Lowe's on it. I managed to hold up my clearance plant hoping to communicate I need help buying this plant and get out ""why does everyone think I work here?"" to which she says ""I think it's the vest"" before, from behind me...

""Hey, do you have [...]?!"" 

I scoot aside thinking he's talking to the actual employee, distinguishable from me due to her red vest that says Lowe's on it, but he's locked in on me. I have no idea what my facial expression conveyed but I just kinda groaned and tried to back away because I am _done_ . 

I point at the actual employee, distinguishable from me by her red vest that says Lowe's on it, and say she's an employee and can help you. And Mr Boomer here, he thinks he's funny I assume. He drops his voice down into Angry Dad/Boss/Cop tone and says very seriously

 ""I don't care. I want to talk to you!"" 

My social battery, already empty, ceased to exist.

I walked away. I just walked away. I felt bad later, a little, because he probably thought he was funny and he's probably fine just clueless but no. No. Just no. Just no. 

There's still no cashiers and I just am standing there with my plant wishing I had not decided to buy a plant and the actual employee, distinguishable from me by her red vest that says Lowe's on it, comes and saves me. I just babbled inanely that I wanted to go home and how it's a denim vest, it's not even red and then finally get to leave. 

It was a denim vest. Blue and embroidered with flowers all over, exactly as Lowe's uniform vests are not. Also had a white eyelet lace tee, grey cargo shorts, Docs and an excessive amount of bright colored jewelry on, none of which said Lowe's on them. It had to be the vest? But people wear vests. I see people wear vests. It is not exclusive to Lowe's employees. It looks nothing like their uniform vest. At all. Other than being a sleeveless garment worn as an outer layer.

Anyway my cat is enjoying eating the plant, which is for the record a small parlor palm. Palms are safe for cats, provided they're true palms. Sago palms, which are actually a cycad, are extremely dangerous for cats, dogs, children and pretty much anything with a pulse. Don't buy sago palms if you have pets or kids. Even the seeds are deadly. Don't buy lilies or other bulb plants with cats, as the lily family is ridiculously deadly to cats. This goes for garlic and onion, too. Don't keep aloe around cats either, as it is also dangerous to them.

I just babbled inanely that I wanted to go home and how it&amp;#39;s a denim vest, it&amp;#39;s not even red and then finally get to leave. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a denim vest. Blue and embroidered with flowers all over, exactly as Lowe&amp;#39;s uniform vests are not. Also had a white eyelet lace tee, grey cargo shorts, Docs and an excessive amount of bright colored jewelry on, none of which said Lowe&amp;#39;s on them. It had to be the vest? But people wear vests. I see people wear vests. It is not exclusive to Lowe&amp;#39;s employees. It looks nothing like their uniform vest. At all. Other than being a sleeveless garment worn as an outer layer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway my cat is enjoying eating the plant, which is for the record a small parlor palm. Palms are safe for cats, provided they&amp;#39;re true palms. Sago palms, which are actually a cycad, are extremely dangerous for cats, dogs, children and pretty much anything with a pulse. Don&amp;#39;t buy sago palms if you have pets or kids. Even the seeds are deadly. Don&amp;#39;t buy lilies or other bulb plants with cats, as the lily family is ridiculously deadly to cats. This goes for garlic and onion, too. Don&amp;#39;t keep aloe around cats either, as it is also dangerous to them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And don&amp;#39;t wear a vest to Lowe&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;

,CasualConversation,"I was babysitting my 5 year old cousin today. We went to a mall, then to a playground. We were driving home to my place to play Mariokart when we, or I mostly, decided we’re going through the McDonald’s drive thru. 

Mind you, he was still full from lunch at the mall before his parents said goodbye to him but I hadn’t had lunch yet. So I planned on getting a combo meal. My go-to would always be the McChicken combo with M Fries, M Vanilla Coke. Little man said he wanted a hamburger and fries. No drink. So I asked if it’s cool with him that we just share the fries. He said aight. 

Now, I don’t order a lot of McDonald’s. I’m more of a Wendy’s gal. But chicken is chicken and that’s what I always get. I pulled up to the drive thru and started ordering my order first. All I had to do was add an order of a hamburger, no pickles.

That’s when I realized I forgot what the plain hamburger is called. McHamburger didn’t sound right in my head. I asked the intercom lady, “Can I also get just a plain burger?” But she was like, “A chicken burger?” So I said “Uh no, just a hamburger. Plain one. No pickles.”

Then there was this weird pause. Just silence. I don’t know if she heard me or I said something wrong. And the menu in front of me is not helping either. It’s all like Big Mac and Quarter pounder stuff. I’m frantically looking for what a plain burger is. Then I saw the McDouble. 

When she asked me again, I just said “Can I just get like something like a McDouble with no pickles, no cheese, and just one patty?”

The girl was just like, “Well, it doesn’t come with cheese.”

To which I replied, “Oh sorry, the picture shows there’s cheese.” 

She rang em up as a mcdouble with no pickles. Anyway, I got my order. It was a McDouble but my boy was just happy with his burger and fries so that’s a happy ending still.

But like, as soon as I got the chance tonight, I looked up what a regular burger is at McDonalds. It IS JUST a hamburger. Why did that lady make me think I said something wrong? She gave me that long silence and for what? Plain McHamburger.

I think I’m gonna just start ordering McDoubles from now on. If I’m ever in the mood for it.

,CasualConversation,"I used to look down on people that locked themselves out from their car, like ‘how the *fuck* do you lock yourself out of your *own car???*’ 

But then it happened to me.

I was on my break, nowhere else to be but my car, so I sat in my car with my door cracked open to let some cool air in. After a while, I realized my doors were unlocked so I locked it. After some more, I wondered how much time I had left in my parking spot so I left my car to check the meter machine six steps away, closing the door behind me out of habit. And boom, locked out of my car, no key, no wallet, and no phone because they are all inside my locked car. 

I made a couple futile attempts with my raw shrimp strength to get the door to open, it was of course no use. So I leaned against my car and looked around, thinking ‘Look at all these people… not locked out of their own car, going about their own lives, I wish that was me.’ 

A stubby guy stopped his car next to me and asked if I was about to leave, I told him “Nah man, I locked myself out.” He then gave me the sorriest look at me and said “Oh sorry to hear, good luck with that.” And drove away, it felt oddly comforting that he didn’t make fun of me for doing something dumb. I then thought about how I wanted to start lockpicking as a hobby in highschool, but the plan fell apart, for the reason I could no longer remember. But what if I did? Maybe I could have gotten away from this mess fast, so fast that no one sees me the way I used to look down on people like me. But that was no use, and the biggest idiot I thought they were, was now me.

I eventually got the car unlocked by borrowing my coworker’s phone and calling a locksmith, he agreed to get paid in cash of $100 once I’m able to get my wallet back from my car. He took maybe 30 seconds to solve my dumb problem. And away he went, as if nothing happened, as if he didn’t just save my day.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m only ranting because I learned that a friend started getting close to my crush/close friend behind my back, knowing all my feelings. I recently saw the messages, and she recently admitted that she also likes this person. I mean, we could have talked about it before it got messy, you know? Why hide everything?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am completely aware that I have no entitlement over anyone; however, I am just confused about the frequency of these events. It makes me feel like I am only a pitstop for people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just don&amp;#39;t understand. Maybe I could be hyper jealous, but I do feel like I deserve a talk or a heads up, at least. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There must definitely be other people who have experienced this. Please feel safe to share your experiences with me &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;

One of the things about noise induced deafness is that it actually affects you at about 2khz which is exactly where women pronounce their plosives: bah, pah, cah. So that’s an early indicator. You battle to hear women talking. 

The point of this message is not that. It’s actually that I learned through ignoring the problem your hearing problem becomes unfixable. The nerves that connect to the cochlear around the first bend (it’s like a tuba) that pick up 2khz will gradually atrophy. That means that even if you get great hearing aids and they amplify the frequencies you don’t hear anymore - the wiring to carry the signal to your brain is no longer there. 

Which is why - if you suspect you have a hearing problem - you really don’t benefit by putting off the diagnosis. If you deal with it promptly you can restore your hearing. If you don’t there comes a point where you never can get more than 75-80% like me. Or worse.

,CasualConversation,"On Monday I flew to Stockholm alone and stayed at a hostel near the city centre for two nights. My first day was ok, poor weather which damaged my camera and I arrived mid-afternoon so I didn't have much time to sight-see but I ended at a cool rock bar called Pub Anchor.

On the second day the weather was brighter so I went off to Kungsträdgården then to the Fotografika Museet. I also checked out the Royal Palace Museum and a cool record store called Sound Pollution, the records they have are so cool! Since I'd been wanting to get a new tattoo for a while I found a place near my hostel and got seen to immediately. It's a simple design of a hooded figure on my forearm, dad hated the idea of me getting a tattoo on my arm but it's my body and no longer live at home. Ended the night by going to Pub Anchor again and that was it.

On Wednesday I got the train to Gothenburg. Truthfully and was honestly mesmerised by the views and some of the houses sat near the lakes. Withoutwanting to sounding cringy, Sweden is a beautiful country. I was a bit nervous I wouldn't like it becuase I had a weird feeling about my hostel (thankfully there was no need to be in the end) and the guy who tattooed me said he's from Gothenburg and there isn't too much touristy stuff to do there. When I got to Gothenburg, I immediately fell in love. It reminded me of Dublin in a way, since the river runs through the middle of the city centre, there are trams everywhere and the pavements look similar. After checking and going for some lunch, I went walking around the city centre for an hour and a half. I then went up the Botaniska Trädgården and wandered around for a good fourty-five minutes.

The following day I went out for lunch then visited the Göteborgs Stadsmuseum and then checked out a record store and went for a walk in a few areas I hadn't been to before. I ended up wandering aimlessly for a good hour or so before going through Haga and up the steps to Skansen Kronan where I could get a great view of the whole city. Afterwards I spent much of the afternoon walking around, having a few pints and checking out the Museum of Art where I saw some paintings by Picasso and Van Gogh along with plenty of others. I ended that night by having a few drinks at Rockbaren.

I flew back to London and honestly I'm sad to be back. I had such an amazing time in Sweden, the cities and countrysides are so beautiful, the people there are so warm and friendly. I'm definitely going to come back for a longer stay (4 days wasn't enough) and try to see more of Sweden. I'd be lying if I didn't momentarily consider moving there.

I've always felt bad for him, but I never knew why I actually had to. I've tried talking to him, but he wouldn't open up.

I thought he was asexual. Like the idea of having a partner just wasn't for him. Because he's introvert.

""I'm sorry for asking,"" I said. ""But do you mean a friend, or do you mean a boyfriend?""

Still a little insecure, he answered ""my boyfriend"".

I had to hold back my tears. When I arrived, I already noticed him being happier and more talkative than before, and now I see why. I'm just so happy for my little brother. He no longer feels the need to hide his true feelings, he finally gets to be who he wants to be.

,CasualConversation,"I probably pay attention to the snack isle more than most people. I have a strange interest in trying new flavors and limited edition products. I like to experiment that way so I’m usually on the hunt for something new to try.

But that being said, I’ve noticed in the past few months that Reese’s takes up a ton of the aisle at the Walmart I go to. They have about a dozen snacks I’ve never seen before.

You got:
Reese’s with pretzel and caramel
Reese’s with wafers
Reese’s in a big cup
Reese’s with crunchy pb
Reese’s with creamy pb
Reese’s with Reese’s puffs inside of it
Reese’s with Reese’s pieces inside of it
Reese’s with potato chips inside of it
Reese’s cake
Reese’s covered pretzels

Reese’s in a big cup
Reese’s with crunchy pb

,CasualConversation,"Hey, this is a weird question, but it’s been on my mind ever since I graduated just because of how weird it is?

I (F18) was a really quiet kid in middle to highschool and only had like two friends, and there was this popular girl that did not like me very much because i was the weird quiet kid, I realized this because whenever we would have to do projects together and I’d try to add something she’d look me up and down, make a face and proceed to ignore me. This isn’t the only thing, but it was just apparent that she didn’t care for me.

One thing she did, which i cannot explain, is that sometimes in the middle of class she would just stare me down. I don’t mean in the “she probably just spaced out way” i mean she made an effort for me to notice that she was staring at me. Like she would lean over and kind of widen her eyes. And when i noticed i would just awkwardly wave or something and try to look away but she wouldn’t ??? stop???? 

I literally have no fucking clue what that was about, but i have several theories:

1. She was doing it to intimidate me, she knew i was shy and wanted to make me nervous

2. There was a rumor going around about me (that i didn’t know of until i graduated so i just recently came to this conclusion) that i was dating the girl i was friends with at one point (..they weren’t wrong LMFAO i did date her) and being gay isnt as normal and accepted in my country so MAYBE she was staring at me to make me nervous and have more material for the gay rumor (such as: omg did you see how nervous she got when i was looking at her she’s definitely into me ew) but i think that’s a stretch.

Anyways yeah no fucking clue. It makes me laugh because of how prolonged and intense the staring was and i’m so curious as to what people think her reasoning for doing this was. (+ she also did it to my friend from said rumor, so it wasn’t just me)

I was scrolling on Instagram and found an art account on my explore. I stalked her profile, she's japanese (from her bio) which, using google translate, I find that she's a middle aged self taught artist. I liked and commented an old post of her from last year, a drawing of a dog. Using google translate, it seems that this dog passed away 12 years ago, but she still thinks about it a lot. 

I left a comment, again, using google translate so I can comment in Japanese, saying that I am so sorry for your loss and that losing a pet is like losing a family member and that it's evident that she loved and continue to love him very much.

This was last night. I woke up this morning to a reply from her, basically thanking me for commenting on this one post instead of her other posts. She said she couldn't paint him soon after he passed as she was just crying, and only managed to paint him recently.

They called me up and asked me if I wanted to do an interview, then told me they'd call back with a date and time.

,CasualConversation,"As a non-North American, until a few years ago I had never tried waffles. But I was always curious about them. 

I bought a cheap waffle maker and Aunt Jemima Pancakes and Waffle mix, got some maple syrup, and I absolutely loved them! No, not the excess sugar from the maple, but I just loved the waffles. 

Eventually, I started making my own mix from scratch. I didn't feel that day and night comparison people talk about so much, but there was definitely an improvement. I started playing with the ratios, cook time, oil in the pan vs no, little, etc. One time an American friend tried it and said I make the best waffles that she ever tried and bathed me in compliments, of course I thought she was just being nice.

Because of this waffle cooking every other weekend, I didn't like picking them up at restaurants so if never had any way of comparing to real waffles! My only piece to compare it to was the Aunt Jemima recipe which I used to follow to the letter, and for me that's the real flavour of one. 

Long story short, very recently I got to try some good restaurant waffles and I was not impressed, my SO confirmed mine were much better. 

So now I feel awesome because I make some kick ass waffles! Thank you for reading.

Edit: Adding the recipe.

- 2.6g - 1/2 tsp baking powder.  
- 70g whole wheat all purpose flour.  
- 15g - 1 tbsp brown sugar  
- 1 large egg.  
- 35g almond milk.  
- 15-16g - 1 1/2 tbsp canola/avocado oil

This will do about 4 medium sized waffles. First mix the dry ingredients, then wet. 

Then just fold them together, don't whisk them, less movement the better so they are as soft as possible.

I heat the waffle maker for 5 minutes while the mix sits in the fridge. Slightly oil the grills, I use a silicone brush to spread as evenly as possible and cook for about 5 minutes or until almost no more steam is coming out of the maker.

,CasualConversation,"My family has always done weekend camping trips as our go-to form of vacation, and every 5 years or so, we'd take a week-long trip to Florida. I still join up with my parents to go camping a few times a year, but haven't taken a week-long trip since highschool. And since then, between being in college and working every weekend, and then shitty, entry-level, fresh-out-of-college jobs, I have never had any PTO. I was allowed take time off if I wanted but was missing out on the pay if I did. So I never took more than a single day off. I also didn't have a partner that was interested in traveling with me until around the time of the pandemic, but you know how the pandemic worked.

In the last year, I've since broken up with that partner (the one who I *was* looking forward to traveling with), and started a new job that provides more PTO than I know what to do with, and I've also gotten a new car!

For a while I've been holding off, basically waiting to find someone to travel with me. But at this rate, I'm gonna work myself to death before that happens. So I booked myself 3 nights in Great Smokey Mountains National Park... Specifically at the campground closest to the Tail of the Dragon!! And I've gone ahead and taken the whole week off to do it, so I can extend the trip and/or just have some time once I get back home.

The drive is a touch over 8 hours each way, which I know I can do in one day if I pace myself correctly. And with basically my entire life spent camping and the gear that I've been accumulating over the last year or so, I'm confident that I'll survive. And my plan for this trip is to have chill mornings and evenings at the campground. I plan on cooking meals at camp and figure I'll bring my Switch along to wind down before bedtime. And during the daytime, I'll cruise around the park, find a trail here and there to go hike, track down restaurants and/or grocery stores, and do a few runs up/down the Tail each day. I'm going to bring my camera and hopefully be able to post up on a corner or somewhere near the entrance and watch all the cars and motorcycles go by.

I know it's a short trip and nowhere near as long distance or as long time-wise as many people do all the time, but it's so many firsts for me.

,CasualConversation,"After going through a breakup with my girlfriend a few months ago, I found myself passing through the city where she lives. Its important to note that she lives in another Country, about 300 km away from where i reside. While there, I visited some friends I had met during our time together and ended up seeing her working at the bar where she always used to work. The experience left me with a realization about relationships, prompting me to reflect on their significance and authenticity.

There was a time when our love felt unbreakable, filled with both tears and laughter. But now, in her presence, our connection felt fake and insubstantial, a mere shadow of what it once was. It's a strange feeling, watching someone who once knew you so intimately from a distance, now a stranger you barely recognize.

Of course, we'll both move on with our lives and find new paths. But the image of her, working away in that dimly lit bar, will forever be etched in my mind. It's a reminder of how easily love can come and go, how quickly things can change, and how we must cherish those we love while we can. Does anyone have something similar happen to them before ?

&amp;#x200B;

Here a little poem i wrote basically immediately after i saw her again:

 

In a foreign land I roamed,                                                                                                                        Passed by familiar streets I called my own,                                                                                                     Amidst my journey, an unexpected slight,                                                                                                    My lost love, now a mere barkeep, out of sight.

Once our love was strong, pure and true,                                                                                                       But now, in her presence, I feel so blue,                                                                                                                              Our connection, once a steadfast bond,                                                                                                          Reduced to nothingness, all gone.

I am but a mere mortal, insignificant,                                                                                                                   In this world, where love is transient,                                                                                                                  The time we shared now a distant memory,                                                                                                               Our once shared life, now a mystery.

Despite the pain, I move on,                                                                                                                                 But the image of her remains etched upon,                                                                                                    A reminder of what once was,                                                                                                                              A love lost, a forgotten cause.

Perhaps this is just my post-breakup sorrow,                                                                                                                      But it has made me ponder for tomorrow,                                                                                                             Are relationships mere facades we adorn,                                                                                                                 Or is true love forever born?",t2_8dpfm71o,False,,0,False,Isnt it crazy how People you considered one of the most important people in your life can turn into complete strangers ?,[],r/CasualConversation,False,6,,0,,False,t3_136spb1,False,dark,0.97,,public,2630,2,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2630,,False,False,,1683139791.0,,[],{},,True,,1683132503.0,text,6,,,text,self.CasualConversation,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;After going through a breakup with my girlfriend a few months ago, I found myself passing through the city where she lives.

,CasualConversation,"A few years back, my family and I were coming home from eating out, and I stepped out of the car, looked up at the night sky, and saw a green light pointing down at the earth. It was slowly moving it’s way across the sky, and I pointed it out to my family. We were all watching it outside, and eventually our neighbors joined us. Rumors spread, since we had no idea what this mysterious bright light was, and our neighbor was telling us that her husband reported stuff falling from it (guess that was a paranoid lie). Eventually, it vanished suddenly into the darkness. Later that night, we learned that it was a rocket!

Fast forward to tonight, when my dad and I were walking the dogs. We were joking about a light (likely a plane) being a UFO, and a few minutes after it disappeared behind some clouds and we continued walking, I spotted a bright string in the sky. I thought it was a weirdly illuminated power line at first, but then realized it wasn’t. As it slowly crept across the night sky, I saw that it was a bunch of little glowing dots moving methodically in a single file line, straight over our heads. I took a bunch of photos, and video, and my dad and I were laughing about it actually being a UFO, and the first one was just a scout. Eventually, it disappeared, and my dad and I continued home to look up what we had potentially witnessed. Turns out, it was Starlink; 2,000 satellites flying overhead!

,CasualConversation,"I grew up around the end of the CD era and at the advent of the MP3 player, so I only had a short time with physical media. Even so, I’d always wanted a record player, and just the other day I finally took that plunge and got one. The first vinyl I bought was one of my all-time favorite albums, *Rumours* by Fleetwood Mac.

I played the album, somewhat underwhelmed by the quality of my record player’s speakers but overall still enjoying myself as I worked from home. “Songbird” ended and the room went silent. I got up, flipped the record, set the needle in place, and heard the first few seconds of the stylus catching the groove. Another short bit of silence, and I was greeted with the plucking of a guitar and the steady beating of the bass drum as “The Chain,” my personal favorite Fleetwood song, began. My body washed over with goosebumps and I found myself smiling reflexively, as though I was experiencing nostalgia for something I’d never personally experienced. This fully sold me on the vinyl experience as I ran out the door and bought a set of bookshelf speakers. 

I also managed to get a used copy of another favorite, *Songs In The Key of Life* by Stevie Wonder, in excellent condition, and the experience was the same. Ending side two of the first vinyl and switching to the second record to begin this “third act” with “Isn’t She Lovely” was wildly satisfying, like a four-act show coming back from intermission with a banger to get the audience back into it. 

I don’t know if I can properly put it into words, but the process of listening to a record feels theatrical compared to streaming music online. It felt like a conscious decision to have the B sides start with strong numbers, a short interlude of silence after an implied first act, then coming back in with a strong second act opener. Maybe that’s how it was intended, but this is lost in streaming as you get the whole album in one go. Meanwhile, those few moments of silent contemplation and reflection before getting up to flip the record, as well as the tracklist order on each side felt like they were fully intended as part of the listening experience. 

Overall, I’m finding the experience of listening to music via vinyl records to be quite a magical one, one that tickles the parts of my brain and soul just right. I’m excited to collect my favorite albums in a physical format; I’ve written a list down and I’m looking forward to crate digging through my local record shops.

Basically I have a habit let's call it that I picked up God knows when. What I do is every night to get to sleep I imagine a super Uber cutesy Lil romance story in my head and basically just use the characters I find most cute together in shows I like. One of the most embarrassing things I could ever admit. Literally made this account as a throw away just to post this cause I'm so embarrassed by it. But anyways it eventually clicked..... I'm just making fanfiction to fall asleep... Blew my mind. And here recently I even more realized.... it's literally a self insert. I don't pretend I'm the main character, but I make the main character reflect my own personal desires which I won't go into. BTW it's never sexual, always just wholesome romance shit. I recently started to wonder about the impact this may be having on me subconsciously.  I do this every single night and have for literal years. I also got dumped by my most serious relationship about a year ago, and have since been basically isolated from other people.

I found a beginner video that I'm going to reference for a few months just to help myself not be so tight. 

I noticed a lot of shocking things on my first time and I'm curious if this means I did it correctly or not?

* Volcano pose, or whatever it's called... I felt like I couldn't breathe and it felt like something was being cut off. I had a lot of pressure in my head where I had to release because it felt like I was going to pass out... Since I live alone, obviously, I had to be mindful about limits.
* My shoulders and arms are a lot weaker than I thought. It was amazing and scary how much a hard time I had supporting myself 
* The easy pose/pose of ease - I could feel things moving in my shoulders
* the spine twist - My lower sides felt on fire
* When I was doing the table pose(?), same thing with my thighs. 

When all was said and done, I feel like I ran really hard, sprinted, for 20 minutes. All of a sudden after I exited and resumed working, I was breathing really hard and actually on the verge of sweating. It was definitely a shocking and interesting experience.

,CasualConversation,"I tried to post this on the subreddit [r/BigBrother](https://www.reddit.com/r/BigBrother/), and my post was removed for no apparent reason.

In Big Brother 8, Dick Donato conspired with his son Vince Donato. Vince would begin a sentence with a letter representing the name of an ally Dick could trust and end the sentence with a letter representing the name of someone Dick could not trust.

Supposedly, production would later alter the way that letters from home worked. Letters where written before the beginning of the season, to prevent people from throwing in coded messages.

To hear what I am talking about, click this link ( [https://youtu.be/Fx4I76cDNLI](https://youtu.be/Fx4I76cDNLI) ) and watch from 2:38- 3:29.

What exactly is the point of letters? To inform the houseguest of something that they could have and probably would have been informed about before the season even began? You may as well take the letter with you into the house on night one, since the letter would already be written by that point.

The above paragraph is what I think, if it is even true that that is how letters from home work. I think that that was made up. When I say that that was made up, I do not mean that the part about Dick conspiring with his son, that is clearly true. I mean I do not think that letters from home are actually required to be written before the start of the season, I think someone made that up.

,CasualConversation,"I created a Reddit account for a Stranger today, and I felt good

&amp;#x200B;

I was walking through the park when I noticed her sitting alone on a bench, staring down at her phone, tears flowing down her cheeks. I didn't want to bother her, yet something about her touched my heart. As I got closer, I noticed she was furiously typing on her phone, her fingers moving so fast as if she wasn't even right words I paused for a bit before approaching her and asking if she was okay.

When she looked up at me with red eyes and a trembling lip, I knew she wasn't okay.

&amp;#x200B;

""My boyfriend just broke up with me,"" she explained, hardly audible above a whisper. ""He left me, no calls or anything. Just a note that said, ""*I thought we had something but it was just Lust, I don't want to ruin your life. I don't think i am good enough for you, Wish you the best*""  


She said 'I loved him, why didn't he come to me and talk about it""

&amp;#x200B;

I was at a loss for words. I've never been good at soothing others, but I just wanted to act. So, I sat down on the seat next to her and we talked for a while. She told me about her lover, how they had been together for three years and how she thought he was the one.

&amp;#x200B;

As we talked, I noticed she was beginning to relax a little. She wasn't crying as much, which made me so much relieved.

&amp;#x200B;

However, she then said something that broke my heart.

&amp;#x200B;

""I don't have anyone I can talk to about this,"" she explained. ""My family is in another state, and all of my friends are also his friends, never in my life I expected to land in this shitty situation.""

&amp;#x200B;

After some time she mentioned that she loved pets but never got a chance to own one, she them opened pinterest and showed me some pics. That's when it clicked.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I figured I could contribute in some little manner. So I asked as to whether she had ever heard of Reddit. and she said no

&amp;#x200B;

I showed her r/cats, r/Aww and r/Wholesomemes, she loved it.  

&amp;#x200B;

And then, without even thinking about it, I volunteered to make her a Reddit account. I told her she could use it to communicate with others, vent her problems, or just join whatever communitues she likes.

&amp;#x200B;

She was sooo intrigued, I enjoyed the creating avatar part lol 

&amp;#x200B;

So I grabbed my phone and created a Reddit account for her. I showed her how to navigate and like how to post. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wasn't sure if it would benefit her. I wasn't sure if anyone would respond to her posts or if she would even continue to use the account. But I hoped that she would forget about the problem.

&amp;#x200B;

I felt a lump in my throat as I stepped away from the bench. I had no idea what her name was, where she was from, or anything else about her.

Just now he was in my lap, and we watched the first vid that came up when you type ""bird"".  
It doesn't end there, though.

There was this mean bird, I called ""Bully Bird"" -- and it kept bullying other birds away from the seeds!

So, naturally, as a pet parent, I was worried. Would this teach my son (cat) food aggression?  
Granted, he's 7 years old, and that's 44 in cat years, but you never know.

Just now he was in my lap, and we watched the first vid that came up when you type &amp;quot;bird&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;
It doesn&amp;#39;t end there, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was this mean bird, I called &amp;quot;Bully Bird&amp;quot; -- and it kept bullying other birds away from the seeds!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, naturally, as a pet parent, I was worried. Would this teach my son (cat) food aggression?&lt;br/&gt;
Granted, he&amp;#39;s 7 years old, and that&amp;#39;s 44 in cat years, but you never know.&lt;/p&gt;

It's given me some amazing experiences that I would have never imagined and a lot of satisfaction and pride in the various creative activities I participated in.

 At the same time, however, I constantly have to deal with all the anti-fans and fans-turned-haters who come into our online spaces and spew sarcasm and hate. 

The whole thing had been a bit quieter since the show ended last summer, which felt great and felt like only genuine fans remained, with whom I could have meaningful and pleasant interactions, but now the show is airing again in reruns and there's a resurgence of all the old haters making fun of everything and everyone in a rather aggressive way.

As if that wasn't enough, I just spent the weekend with a few of my fandom friends, one of whom I hadn't met in person before. At the end of our trip she confessed that she doesn't really care about the show anymore and in fact she hates most things about it,  considers it rubbish, and her online fan persona (including endless pages of fanfic) is just a thing she does ""just so"" and because it earns her community approval. While I'm not entirely sure whether to believe this, because I have noticed many inconsistencies in this person's behavior in the past (like changing her mind about what she likes/believes or making declarations and overreactions that are proven not genuine) it has really affected me to the point where I almost feel catfished.

Now this ""secret"" feels like a big burden, because I would be super mean if I called this person out in our online space where she's worshiped by some younger members, so I feel I have to keep this info to myself and pretend I never heard it.

It&amp;#39;s not something that you might see in TV or movies or pretty beds on Pinterest, it&amp;#39;s just a plank with 4 wooden legs. But whenever I have to face an unsolvable problem, or whenever I break down, or had a rough day, I just lay for a bit and then a few minutes later, I&amp;#39;m fine. There&amp;#39;s something in it that I cannot get in other things. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s yours? I&amp;#39;d like to hear your story, or just chat for a bit. I&amp;#39;m just a bit bored. That&amp;#39;s all.&lt;/p&gt;

how can i be the most genuine and loving person to her in our friendship. im struggling with trust issues badly right now but i really do think she might be the answer to my prayers for connection. im tired of being isolated. i know its okay to be alone but i cant even begin the great lack of social life i have as an 18 year old. also please give some examples of friend boundaries. my parents were a bit controlling and i could never say no to their requests even if i was doing something important. i have trouble communicating.",t2_95v8srdch,False,,0,False,"i want to be a real friend, and/but i don’t want to be taken advantage of","[{'a': ':chat:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/04fpiw4fukg21_t5_323oy/chat'}, {'e': 'text', 't': ' Just Chatting'}]",r/CasualConversation,False,6,,0,,False,t3_136stut,False,light,0.67,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},:chat: Just Chatting,False,1,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1683132786.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.CasualConversation,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;i 18f have been a loner as long as i can remember. i started college august 2022 hoping to build strong bonds but i peeped too much weird stuff. my roommate 19f was my friend of 10 years and well … longer story short we are no longer friends. we had actually stopped being friends but decided to rebuild our bound and live together so we wouldn’t have to live with strangers and long story short again… i have never felt so disrespected in my life.

there’s this one girl im talking to and i really think she’s my godsend. we have the same birthday (God told me to ask her one day out of the blue and i was so shocked) and today she told me she was reading her bible at the river. (she texted me hello at 11:11 AM) everytime she vents, we both vent. she told me she’s been having the same problem with female friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;how can i be the most genuine and loving person to her in our friendship. im struggling with trust issues badly right now but i really do think she might be the answer to my prayers for connection. im tired of being isolated. i know its okay to be alone but i cant even begin the great lack of social life i have as an 18 year old. also please give some examples of friend boundaries. my parents were a bit controlling and i could never say no to their requests even if i was doing something important. i have trouble communicating.&lt;/p&gt;

,CasualConversation,"Do you ever do this? Try to figure out the Big Five personality of fictional characters?

If you're unfamiliar with the Big Five, it is a personality theory according to which humans have five dimensions to their personality (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits):

Openness to experience (inventive/curious vs. consistent/cautious)

Conscientiousness (efficient/organized vs. extravagant/careless)

Extraversion (outgoing/energetic vs. solitary/reserved)

Agreeableness (friendly/compassionate vs. critical/rational)

Neuroticism (sensitive/nervous vs. resilient/confident)


So what I often do is try to figure out where a fictional character would land on these five dimensions.

For example, for Sheldon Cooper from the Big Bang Theory:

Openess to experience and Conscientiousness: Probably exceptionally high 

Extraversion: Seems very low but not obvious to me. He seemed to become less averse to people and social conatct as the show progressed.

Agreeableness: Similar to extraversion, he relatively more agreeable by the end of the show especially towards his friends and family. Although, would still probably be on the lower end of the spectrum.

Neuroticism: I'm not sure. He seemed very scared of seemingly trivial things. On the other hand, he was also incredibly fearless when it came to social situations often saying dangerously rude things to people.

What do you think? Where do you think Sheldon would land on the Big Five?

My husband is a logger and I’m a SAHM that homeschools. Well my husband’s boss decided last week they were gonna go to a tract of timber out of state and they’d be staying nearby the site. I’ve been with my husband nearly 13yrs, lived with him for 10 of those and we’ve never been away from each other like this. 

We have a six year old as well that’s never been away from her daddy in her entire life. She cried to him last night that she didn’t want him to go. I got a little teary then and this morning when he left. 

He’ll be back Friday, stay home this weekend then go back Monday. He’s gonna come home Tuesday night because I’m having surgery next Wednesday, which has also been an added stressor. But overall they could be doing this for a month. I dunno if my husband will keep staying there or opt to drive since it’s only 2hrs but he was gonna see how things went this week. 

Anyways the surgery is nothing major. I’m getting my tubes removed. But I guess it’s the fact it’s been so long since I’ve had any kinda surgery it’s got me a bit anxious. I was gonna have to go to the hospital Thursday to get bloodwork and an ekg done but luckily I was able to get it done at a local hospital close to home. 

Which, it was a a bit of stressful ordeal because the fax wasn’t acting right, but I’m glad I could have it done there because the hospital I’m having surgery is like an hr/hr and a half away and in a major city that I didn’t care to go to by myself. 

I didn’t sleep well at all last night knowing he was gonna be leaving this morning and probably won’t sleep too well the rest of the week either. Several family members have offered us to stay with them but like I said I’m not afraid to be in my home, it’s just weird.

,CasualConversation,"So my boyfriend &amp; I have lived in SW Florida for 30+ years. We've very much enjoyed living here for most of those 30 years. But over the last 3-5 years, it has changed a lot. What used to be quiet/easy living has turned into somewhat of a rat race. Way too many people, too much traffic, too expensive &amp; water that's gotten too polluted. My boyfriend &amp; I both agree that the the Florida life we experienced for those 25+ years is gone. Florida (especially in the coastal communities like where we live) has changed forever.

Currently, I have a couple of extended family members who need me around right now. They're older in age with health issues and I need to be around to look after them. My boyfriend is OK with this and has no issue with staying in Florida to help them as long as needed. But he wants to move out of the state when we are no longer needed by these 2 family members. 

I've never been good at moving even it's within the same town. Quite simply, change scares the crap out of me. I do not want to move &amp; I always tell him this when he brings it up. Moving out of state almost feels like starting life over again. If I were to continue to deny his request to move, he'd be OK with that decision. He's not a pushy or demanding guy and always looks to make me happy.

,CasualConversation,"Hi guys! I’m in a bit of a predicament. I moved out and went to college at 18 and after graduation lived in Orange County, CA and later San Diego, CA. I LOVED San Diego and all of my friends are there. It just feels like home to me.

Unfortunately, after a very rough breakup with my boyfriend of 5 years I decided to move back home to my mom’s house to stabilize mentally and get back on my feet. I have since gone back to school to change careers, and I am working part time. 

I hated it at home initially, but I developed a plan to move out and back to Southern California in June of this year when I have a short break between classes. Socially, I feel really isolated up in the Bay Area at my mom’s and I have struggled to find a new group of friends, although I have made a few (I’m not super close with anyone). My ex boyfriend also has our three cats and I would really like to get one of them back when I move out (my mom is allergic).

In terms of social life, independence, and having my cat back, moving to San Diego is a very exciting option for me. I really thrived there. But it is extremely expensive and with doing full time school and working part time now, it will likely eat a portion of my savings. My mom has offered to help me substantially with my rent, but I feel that I will be so busy with work and school that I may not have much of a social life anyways down there and moving might not justify the cost. 

I have found roommates that I’m excited about living with and we are looking for housing, but I’m entirely split at this point regarding my decision. I’ve enrolled for classes at both places and I still haven’t told my job definitively when I will be leaving. A friend of mine here also said she would try to help me get a job serving at her work, so I have the opportunity to make a lot of money here and live rent-free.

I also struggle with mental health issues and appreciate the comfort of knowing that my mom and family are here in case I start to have issues. But honestly, I’m pretty miserable and lonely living at home.

Does anyone have any thoughts? I’m incredibly torn about this decision and I need to make my mind up because I’m supposed to move in a month if I decide to. I don’t want to bail on my roommates, or give notice at my job last minute.

&lt;p&gt;For example, I once in a while find myself whistling the intro of the song ‘Engel’ by Rammstein. And it’s not like it’s my favorite song or in my rotation or something. I have not listened to that song for years, but will still be unconsciously whistling it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this quite intriguing and was wondering if you guys could recall something similar from your life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a whistling day!&lt;/p&gt;

There's a Chinese restaurant right down the block where I live that's very conveniently located near a gym I go to thrice a week and the subway station where I go to every day to go to uni.

So when I'm on my way to the gym or the subway, I'd buy these Chinese iced tea with no sugar to drink during the workout and a fortune cookie. When I'm done with the workout, I'd buy a small size of white rice and come back home to mix it with some meat that I cook at home. Sometimes when I'm lazy, I'd buy a small size rice + chicken and pay the usual amount.

Since we're seeing each other practically every day and depending on how free she is, we'd exchange a causal conversation where I ask her how her day was and talk about food or this and that, you know just bring friendly. It got to the point where she automatically knows what I want depending on my time of the day it's actually amazing hahaha.

So today I went there at dinner time (very unusual for me) and I told her ""Yeah lemme get the usual, small rice with chicken"". She said they added a new type of chili chicken and she recommends it and I asked her to go ahead.

She said, ""Alright lemme serve you a bigger portion this time to savour it"" and she picks up a LARGE spoonful of chicken and puts it into the box and stuffs it with rice. Then she charges me for the same amount she usually charges for small portion.

I pull out my deck of cards and show her a magic trick as a way of saying thank you. She enjoyed the trick so much that she invited the rest of her family to see the trick (if was their closure time) and they all were laughing at the magic that had just happened and it completely made my day.

I don’t drink, I’m not a very good dancer, and big groups and loud music usually make me uncomfortable, but my friends were hosting a party, and I wanted to be there for them, so I signed up for the roll of “emotional support sober person.”

And I had a fantastic night. I didn’t drink, and just tried to keep my drunk friends safe and comfortable, and I loved it. My friends were so much fun to be around that I didn’t need to be drunk to match the energy they were exuding, and I got to help make sure they didn’t overdo it. It was a night of giving people hugs and piggy back rides, making sure they didn’t hurt themselves, and consoling them while they vomited their guts out. Not stuff that most people would find fun, but it felt so rewarding to know that, for the first time ever, I felt like I actually belonged at a party.

As a big tall awkward man, I’ve always felt a bit self conscious about people feeling uncomfortable around me, especially women. When my friend told me that she was glad I was there and I made her feel safe, I felt so happy and valuable, I almost cried.

Afterwards I helped my friends wind down for the night and make it home safe, and the best part is, I got to wake up the next morning without any adverse consequences from the previous night.

For the first time ever I actually enjoyed partying, and I learned just how much I love taking care of my friends. :)

Funny shows like the office/community/Brooklyn 99/New Girl/modern family

Psychological shows like Servant or Yellow jackets

Antihero shows like the Sopranos/Mad Men/breaking bad



Netflix's selection now is just Garbo lol like they have Breaking Bad/BCS, Community, Black Mirror, Stranger Things, The Ozarks, Maniac, Squid Game...and that's honestly all I can even think of right now that's even slightly compelling. Half of those aren't original programs and only 3, stranger things, black mirror, and Squid Game are even still putting out new content.

And Black mirror is incredibly sporadic with its releases and there's very few episodes when it does come out.


So like what is even good on Netflix now? Like literally outside the shows I said, what has Netflix got that's even worth watching? (This is a serious question if anyone has any recommendations. I've already tried Dark and Black Summer and I just don't like them...Dark seems like it would be really cool if made by HBO or Apple, it just feels super low budget and lame to me the way Netflix did it)

And a bonus question, is there even **one** upcoming new Netflix show that looks incredibly promising? Like even one **completely new show** coming out that looks like a slam dunk home run?

Do they make anything new at all, ever, that they commit to?


The last really good Netflix original show Netflix had for me was The Society. That show had everything I wanted (personally) super fucking compelling programming, and they just cancelled it cuz COVID (i.e. they didn't want to pay the extra money to make the show work shooting schedule wise because it was logistically harder)

I have not seen a good brand new Netflix show in years.

It always confused me in Hollywood movies when they would walk out of a soapy tub and just put on a towel. Wouldn't all that foam make you feel dirty? And if you didn't use soap at all, what's the point? It's like dipping briefly in a warm pond. Or, if you're gonna shower before or after the bath, isn't the bath itself kind of just a waste of water?

I grew up using buckets and big mugs. Classic Asian household. About 7 years ago, we started using showers and geisers, which was a nice change of pace from buckets, immersion rods and steaming kettles. Then recently, my parents finished the house they've saved up for and built for the past 8 years. It has a small bathtub, which is probably the most luxurious bath item I have personally set eyes on. It's not exciting, it's more awkward and unusual.

In keeping with the internet trends, I bought a cheap bath bomb to make the experience memorable. It was the most interesting part of the whole thing, honestly. It made the water blue and smell like flowers. I added some bubble bath solution and made sure the water was warm, like the wikiHow article says. I stepped in, lay down, and tried to relax. But it wasn't easy.

I kept thinking how many buckets of water this tub was. I could bathe and be clean on half a bucket of water. And here I was, dipped in a foamy well, full of water that would be drained after my use. I even wondered if there were ways to save this water for use later. Then I felt silly that I didn't shower before making it dirty. Which is also silly because this part is supposed to be the actual bath.

I also read some people shower after the bath, which just strikes me as further waste of water. I thought about how, just a decade ago, I helped my parents line up before the ground well pump, getting bucketfuls of brown, muddy water that we would boil and filter best as we could, because we couldn't afford the government's supply, or because that supply ran short.

Hey everyone, I just wanted to see if there were any other Sims 3 fans out there. I know it's an older game now, but I recently started playing again and I forgot how much fun it is.

I love how much freedom the game gives you to create and control your own virtual world. From designing your Sim's appearance and personality to building and decorating their homes, there are endless possibilities for creativity. And let's not forget about all the expansion packs that add even more content to the game!

One of my favorite things about Sims 3 is how unique each playthrough can be. Depending on the choices you make for your Sim and the relationships they form, the story can take so many different paths. It's like playing out your own little soap opera!

I know it&amp;#39;s an older game now, but I recently started playing again and I forgot how much fun it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love how much freedom the game gives you to create and control your own virtual world. From designing your Sim&amp;#39;s appearance and personality to building and decorating their homes, there are endless possibilities for creativity. And let&amp;#39;s not forget about all the expansion packs that add even more content to the game!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite things about Sims 3 is how unique each playthrough can be. Depending on the choices you make for your Sim and the relationships they form, the story can take so many different paths. It&amp;#39;s like playing out your own little soap opera!&lt;/p&gt;

By not so casual I mean deep, or controversial, perhaps wild or dark or whatever... But I don't like private conversations, I feel ""trapped"" in them for some reason, so I prefer them to be public.

First off I know walk in closets are not the norm in most houses but they are becoming pretty standard in new houses. My husband and I have one of these new houses and omg if we ever build another new house we are absolutely putting the washer and dryer in the closet.

They are currently in our mudroom on a different floor like in many other houses and I'm not a fan.

I sat there wondering why this isn't a standard thing everywhere - NO MORE LAUNDRY BASKETS, no lugging laundry up stairs and dropping socks. No dirty laundry pile to drag back down the stairs. It's all in one room!!

Now I understand this isn't practical for homes with more than a single couple like us that isn't ever planning on having kids because it separates the laundry from the rest of the household. BUT, stay with me here, what about a cheater laundry room scenario? Where you get access through a hallway door?

Would it kill our resale value since people aren't huge on living in a house that crazy people once lived? Probably.

,CasualConversation,"When I was around 8 years old I went to an adventure/theme park based in the UK. While playing in a castle themed wood-chip play area I climbed up one of the towers by ladder into the small room. There were around 10 or 12 of these towers around the play area. When I entered my head into the small room I was met with the sight of a huge shit in the corner covered in flies and a pair of blue socks covered on shit also. Disgusting and weird but yeah, these things happen.

When I was 15 I moved to another city on the other side of the country and became best friends with a kid on my street. We’re still best friends now 16 years later.

One day we were talking and the theme park came up to which my friend told me he did a shit in one of the rooms in the castle play area when he was 8 and that he wiped his arse with his socks. I was astonished and asked him particularly which tower and what colour were the socks. He said they were blue and described the same tower.

While playing in a castle themed wood-chip play area I climbed up one of the towers by ladder into the small room. There were around 10 or 12 of these towers around the play area. When I entered my head into the small room I was met with the sight of a huge shit in the corner covered in flies and a pair of blue socks covered on shit also. Disgusting and weird but yeah, these things happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was 15 I moved to another city on the other side of the country and became best friends with a kid on my street. We’re still best friends now 16 years later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day we were talking and the theme park came up to which my friend told me he did a shit in one of the rooms in the castle play area when he was 8 and that he wiped his arse with his socks. I was astonished and asked him particularly which tower and what colour were the socks. He said they were blue and described the same tower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I saw my future best friends shit 7 years before I moved across the country and met him.&lt;/p&gt;

That being said, my wife (28F) and I (30M) have recently started to look for a new apartment recently since our current lease ends in July. We do not plan on having any kids and apartment living really fits our lifestyle. For the past four years we have lived at an apartment complex that has a shuttled to our college campus but was not considered student living. The main selling point was it was a 2 bed 2 bath on the bottom floor and had the shuttle ride to the university. Starting rent was in the ball park of $1019, 4 years ago. Nothing special normal black whirlpool appliances, working AC, small patio and the normal amenities such as a small (outdated) gym, a beautiful resort style pool and a sun tanning deck that was recently installed. 

For the past two years we have been extremely grateful that we have jobs that our combined income puts us at almost twice the average household income for the large city we live in. She is a teacher and I work in a niche sales support role (has nothing to do with my degree just wanted one). Our net take home after all tax/deductions/max 401 is roughly 7k, by no means ""living large"" but we are not living paycheck to paycheck. Once again in no way saying we are above anyone but are in a position in which we feel comfortable making a change.

Back to our apartment, we got a renewable notice for $1402, still well within our budget. We've only had one incident since living here where a Pitbull attacked my wife and dog while on a walk and the owner was evicted  (we have breed restrictions), which sucked due to both of us growing up with family pits and now my wife feels a bit uneasy around pits she's never met. Nothing has been updated in our unit during these four years, with that said we've had zero issues with maintenance request not being handled in a timely manner. 

Being curious by nature I wanted to shop around and look at nearby rentals, we both work roughly 10 mins from our currently apartment. I was shocked to find the available complexes in the same surround area of our work going for roughly $1500-$1600, but with major unit renovations. So reddit, I would like to casually talk about my decision making process and get some feedback on it while deciding what our next move will be.

Choice A (My favorite): Closest to both our jobs \~ 5 mins ($1560)

Newly developed complex in the last 5 years, has a one bedroom with a HUGE 20x18 living room (enough space to combine our current living room and office), Garden tub with decorative tile (not that generic white subway tile), all new stainless steel appliance, farm style sink, vinyl throughout the floorplan, amazing infinity pool, gym that could fit 10+ people and the best part, has a decently sized attached yard that leads to the corner of the property with a gate with a small field I could let me dog run freely in. 

Choice B (Wife's favorite): \~ mins from work ($1520)

Built in the last two years, 1 bedroom, normal sized living room with this awesome split off den/dinning area (would be a new office), all new appliance, garden tub and vinyl through the floorplan, nice gym and resort style pool. My wife only likes this one more due to the fact the dog park had a ""doggie pool"". As cool as that sounds I just don't want a wet dog coming home daily. 

Choice C (Do nothing): \~ 10 mins from work ($1402)

Just renew, this is the beast we know. We have grown accustomed to the noises above us and our one shared wall. Have always felt safe outside that one incident with my wife. Just hate that as the price is increasing the complex isn't do much to make these feel ""luxury"" compared to other complexes. 

Monthly expenses are roughly $2900 including: Utilities, phone service, vehicle car notes, car insurance, misc expenses, roughly $500 of that is just food for the month for us two (food prices have not skyrocketed in my state) and student loans. In two years that will drop closer to $2000 as both our vehicles will be paid off, no plan on trading in or selling anytime within the next 5 year-10 years (both have less than 30k miles each). That leaves us with roughly $4000 left over without rent included. As of right now we put away roughly $1500 a month into savings as one day we do want to buy a condo or townhome, we don't want a large house. Our plan is also not buying for about another 5 years as we want to make sure this is the town we want to settle down in (honestly don't care if we never buy I'd be happy in an RV).

As of right now we put away roughly $1500 a month into savings as one day we do want to buy a condo or townhome, we don&amp;#39;t want a large house. Our plan is also not buying for about another 5 years as we want to make sure this is the town we want to settle down in (honestly don&amp;#39;t care if we never buy I&amp;#39;d be happy in an RV). Both a extremely frugal people and love doing free stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great State of Texas incase anyone was wondering.&lt;/p&gt;

About me: I have a technical background (programmer), can do graphic design, also have a background in bioinformatics and a strong interesting in science and biology (microbiology).

But part of me is open to suggestions away from a screen, because maybe that'll balance my day out more.

I would truly like to advance society in some way (i.e. life saving drug discovery) - so any hobbies or volunteer work that helps do that would be amazing.
