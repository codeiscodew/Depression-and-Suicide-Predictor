,CasualConversation,"For the last 5 or so years I've been in a constant battle with depression and I let it hold me back so much that I felt like I wasted my 20's (I'm 26 now). I had kind of accepted that I was gonna just be miserable all the time and I realized that I was holding onto my depression, not the other way around. I haven't had any confidence in myself after a series of huge failures, and I was just dwelling on those failures. I also realized that I don't ***know*** myself. I don't know what ***I*** like, everything I've done has been to establish an image for myself. But it wasn't ME. I thought it was, and that's why I didn't believe in myself cause even the things I thought I liked were making me miserable. So I said enough is enough, I'm gonna do what I want to do for no other reason than I want to. Not to create an image of how I want people to see me. And this week I've taken my first steps into finding ME.

So this week I stepped out of my comfort zone and decided to do something that I can feel a sense of accomplishment about. I started learning a second language, German. I had tried to learn Russian a few years back but I gave up after a week or so. But I got a notification randomly from Duolingo so I said Screw It and dove head first into German, and it's going great. My only REAL motivation is that I want to visit my family's town in Bavaria and would like to be able to communicate when I do go. But other than that, it's just something I've never done and decided to dive into with no expectations. But it's amazing what it's done for my mental health! I feel good when I get a sentence right or finish a lesson with no mistakes, I feel GOOD. I haven't said that in years. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then I took a huge step and applied for a second job. I've only ever worked for my family's business, it's a desk job in an office in a shop on the same property as my wife and I's house. My whole existence takes place within about 1 square mile, and it was killing me. The pay is good, and the hours are flexible, but I felt no accomplishment. But I've always wanted to work on cars. I never thought I'd do it as a career but always wanted to, I just never believed I could do it. I love tinkering with things, working with my hands, and I love cars. So on a whim yesterday I applied for a part time job at a mechanics shop near me. No real expectations, as I've applied for probably 10 different jobs over the years and never gotten one because they assume I'm overqualified based on my current job. Which sucked cause even if I am as far as skills, I WANT to do something else. I didn't need a second job financially, my wife and I live comfortably with our two incomes, but I needed something new in my life and something that I can be proud of. So, this Friday I have an interview! The only other time I've done an interview was for an intern position at a recording studio (music has been my passion for the last 16 years) but didn't get the job (one of my big ""failures"" in life). I'm nervous, not about the interview but about doing something new. I know it'll be good for me, and I know I'll love it, it's just that I'm stepping out of my comfort zone in a way I never had before. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I'm fighting my depression by trying new things and being unashamedly ME, killing the image of myself that I had spent years creating that made me miserable, and doing what I want to do for no other reason than it's what I wanna do.",t2_qs1p0g2,False,,0,False,I'm finally making progress in my war against depression and I'm loving it,"[{'a': ':party:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/9wz3enklinx91_t5_323oy/party'}, {'e': 'text', 't': ' Celebration'}]",r/CasualConversation,False,6,,0,,True,t3_12k7vqe,False,light,1.0,,public,10,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},:party: Celebration,False,10,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1681351197.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.CasualConversation,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the last 5 or so years I&amp;#39;ve been in a constant battle with depression and I let it hold me back so much that I felt like I wasted my 20&amp;#39;s (I&amp;#39;m 26 now). I had kind of accepted that I was gonna just be miserable all the time and I realized that I was holding onto my depression, not the other way around. I haven&amp;#39;t had any confidence in myself after a series of huge failures, and I was just dwelling on those failures. I also realized that I don&amp;#39;t &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; myself. I don&amp;#39;t know what &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; like, everything I&amp;#39;ve done has been to establish an image for myself. But it wasn&amp;#39;t ME. I thought it was, and that&amp;#39;s why I didn&amp;#39;t believe in myself cause even the things I thought I liked were making me miserable. So I said enough is enough, I&amp;#39;m gonna do what I want to do for no other reason than I want to. Not to create an image of how I want people to see me. And this week I&amp;#39;ve taken my first steps into finding ME.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this week I stepped out of my comfort zone and decided to do something that I can feel a sense of accomplishment about. I started learning a second language, German. I had tried to learn Russian a few years back but I gave up after a week or so. But I got a notification randomly from Duolingo so I said Screw It and dove head first into German, and it&amp;#39;s going great. My only REAL motivation is that I want to visit my family&amp;#39;s town in Bavaria and would like to be able to communicate when I do go. But other than that, it&amp;#39;s just something I&amp;#39;ve never done and decided to dive into with no expectations. But it&amp;#39;s amazing what it&amp;#39;s done for my mental health! I feel good when I get a sentence right or finish a lesson with no mistakes, I feel GOOD. I haven&amp;#39;t said that in years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I took a huge step and applied for a second job. I&amp;#39;ve only ever worked for my family&amp;#39;s business, it&amp;#39;s a desk job in an office in a shop on the same property as my wife and I&amp;#39;s house. My whole existence takes place within about 1 square mile, and it was killing me. The pay is good, and the hours are flexible, but I felt no accomplishment. But I&amp;#39;ve always wanted to work on cars. I never thought I&amp;#39;d do it as a career but always wanted to, I just never believed I could do it. I love tinkering with things, working with my hands, and I love cars. So on a whim yesterday I applied for a part time job at a mechanics shop near me.

But the more I look back, the more I notice that I've been losing a lot of relationships I felt very passionate and strongly about over the years - way more than the ones I've had the chance to build. I feel like I've been struggling to be invested and passionate about people the way I used to be when I was in my late teens / early adult life - though it's only been a handful of years. There's a lot under that rug though, so I won't pull it up if you don't ask!

The same seems to be true for crushes and love: what used to be butterflies for many different people per year has now turned to my last love interest having happened about two years ago. Again, there's monsters under that bed, but I've grown not to fear them anymore.

I've been thinking over this a lot lately. I'm just not sure if they're concerns or if it's only natural as years go by and as my responsibilities and routine change that my relations and habits around people change as well, or maybe if it's just how most people grow as they reach and develop into adulthood.

I just had to share a story about a small act of kindness that had a huge impact on my day.

By the time I reached the bus stop, I was on the verge of tears, feeling completely overwhelmed.

As I stood there waiting for the bus, a kind stranger noticed my distress and offered me a warm smile. They then struck up a friendly conversation, asking me about my day and sharing a few funny anecdotes to cheer me up. It was such a simple gesture, but it made all the difference. Before I knew it, my mood had lifted, and I felt so much lighter.

The bus arrived, and as we parted ways, the stranger patted me on the back and said, ""Remember, there's always a silver lining, and tomorrow is a new day!""

I am a 31 year old woman. I've been aware of my attraction to girls/women since high school. I identified as bi for a while, though I've only ever dated guys. I now identify as queer (idk, the term just feels cozy to me).

On these dreaded dating sites, I swipe right on so many women. Sooooo mannnnyyyy womeeeeennnnn.... but I'm basically invisible to all of them. I get some overinflated amount of interest from guys, and once in a blue moon, a girl would swipe right on me, and leave tumbleweed in the chat.

Since I'm genuinely attracted to guys, I return their interest because it's easy and I've been doing it for years. I've kissed women before, but never dated one ever.

I started this new job almost a year and a half ago. I'm naturally pretty good at what I do, things make sense, things click. So, my boss has assigned me new things and allowed me to take on tasks. I actually like my boss, I think she's good at her job and very good at being diplomatic. She notified us a month ago that she's retiring (2 months from then). It was then found out that I'll be taking over some of the roles she was doing, new processes that are new to the entire team. 

Today, a co-worker asked me to look at something with her so I went to her desk to look it over. She had her teams messenger up on the other screen and on it, a conversation with a supervisor (not my supervisor, but there's only 2 supervisors at our small office). In this conversation they were talking about how I'm a brown noser, I've been dressing up a lot lately and they wonder what that's all about (we have a business casual code,I literally wore jeans with a sport coat yesterday and today I wore black slacks with a business style shirt. I'm horrible at fashion so I'm honestly kind of excited when an outfit looks nice), how I think I'm special because I'm doing some of ""the big man's"" work, and how she's frustrated that I got the assignment and she wasn't considered.

I know, I shouldn't have even read it but saw my name and it was right there on the screen for 15 minutes before she realized it and minimized it.

,CasualConversation,"As a kid who grew up watching l three Jurassic Park movies despite not being a kid in the 1990s I did enjoy watching them a lot as a kid, mostly because one of my special interests at the time was Dinosaur's &amp; the Jurassic Park movies happened to be about them lol. 

I loved Watching the Jurassic Park movies as a kid, despite not growing up in the 90s it was because I had a special interest with dinosaurs. So when I heard that there would be a ""Jurassic Park 4"" I got pretty excited, I remember all the trailers &amp; news about the movie that came out before it released, especially that Awesome viral marketing websites that were made for the movie I.E the JurassicWorld.com website that acted as a fake ARG-type website for the Jurassic World resort on Isla Nublar, sadly it's not active anymore but we also got MasraniGlobal.com which had some very interesting information on it talking about the origins of the park &amp; what happened between Jurassic Park 3 and Jurassic World. So in preparation to re-watch the movie I decided to check out both sites again with some help from the way back machine and also played the Lego game again.

Eventually when the movie released me &amp; my family went to see it in theathers and I remembered walking out satisfied with what I go but also found some of the complaints about the movie to be a bit weird &amp; confusing personally speaking, but anyways I couldn't wait to see what came next. To sorta left my special interest phase about Dinosaurs eventually, but due to nostalgia reasons I decided to watch the movie again &amp; I still think it's decent and ages well. But I do have some thing to say about it, both positive and negative:

- Positives: 

- Visually I thought the movie looked incredible! The CGI on the Dinosaurs looks photorealistic at points, although that's to be expected as ILM were the people who did the CGI for the movie. But I also thought the animatronic puppets used were of high quality as well, apparently the Raptors when there in the ""mussel cages"" were animatronic puppets &amp; apparently during Filming Bryce Dallas Howard actually got genuinely emotional during the scene where the apatosaurus dies as the animatronic puppet used was very life-like to her. 

- I think that the production team did an ABSOLUTELY AMAZING job with making Jurassic World look &amp; feel-like a real theme park and resort that you could visit IRL, it kinda makes me want to visit it.

- I thought the movie had some cool concepts that were executed well such as the ""I.B.R.I.S"" Velociraptors in the movie &amp; the I-Rex as a whole were cool to watch, some of them were original ideas while others were either taken from the Novels that the movies were based on (The I-Rex Camouflaging is a reference to The Lost World novels Camouflaging Carnotaurus) or came from other sources, such as how the I-Rex being a hybrid was taken from the ""chaos effect"" toyline from the 90s.

- Most of the actors give good performances in the movie, even if there isn't much to them as people personally speaking. But they all play their parts well &amp; I wasn't really asking for deep complex characters from a drama flick in a Jurassic Park movie. But I do think that some of the protagonists stand out &amp; I didn’t have much to say about the movie’s antagonists “Hoskins” played by Vincent  Vincent D'Onofrio as he’s basically just a satirical take on the people who fuel the military industrial complex.

- You cannot go wrong with Irfan Khan, the guy is extremely charming &amp; likable in this movie to where I actually got kinda sad when his character died, especially since he’s sadly gone from us as he was also very likable and charming IRL :(

- I Liked seeing the Dinosaur’s just being themselves in the movie &amp; especially seeing the original T-Rex “Rexy” back again, I still get chills seeing her walk out of her enclosure towards the flare where she then attacks the I-Rex and it’s just nice to see her again :)

- I also think the movies is very well paced, but could have used some more scenes that I wish weren’t removed.

- I liked how the movie took itself fairly seriously from start to finish &amp; even had some mildly gory death scenes which I’m surprised that they got away with. It’s very in-line with what we got in the previous movies. Like I remember my little sister got traumatized watching this in theaters, especially when the character Zara died.

- the soundtrack by Micheal Gichino is pretty good to listen too, &amp; I still listen to it at points.

- I though the satirical commentary about how the I-Rex is basically a metaphor for Hollywood capitalism I thought was clever as it basically attacks &amp; goes around killing the dinosaurs &amp; was was only created to be a short term spectacle, which is reminiscent of Hollywood studios basically changing something to where it’s seemingly unrecognizable from what it originally was for short term monetary profits. But it also adds some complexity to the I-Rex as it never asked to be born and was pretty much made to be a spectacle which is a bit tragic.

All in all there’s a lot I liked about the movie, but now I’ll discuss some things I didn’t like. Which luckily isn’t as big as this list.

Negatives:

- There was a Deleted scene involving the two boys that would have happened when they end up finding the old visitor center &amp; walk into the garage with the old jeeps, where they basically would have just sat down/relaxed as they’d been chased around up until that point in the movie, where they would have talked and that whole divorcement storyline would have been addressed to where the little kid “grey” would have talked about how he was excited for this trap because he thinks this is one of the last times he would have gotten to interact with his brother as they would have been separated due to there parents divorcing, &amp; how grey was “annoying” his older brother Zach because he just wanted to spend time with him and not just be alone and away from him for the rest of his life. Which could have caused Zach to go through a character change, which would have given him a motivation to fix up the old Jeep so they can escape back to the park. I wish this was kept in as it would have been a nice quieter part f the movie focused on the characters. Also it would explain where Al the random water puddles in the parks main street would have came from as it would be raining in the scene for ambient effect. Not to mention it would have acted as foreshadowing to the ending of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, as during there conversation Grey would have said something along the lines of “so this is what a world with dinosaurs would be like? People who are worried &amp; scared about what will happen.” 

- I thought the movie had a few moments that I feel felt a bit forced, such as the I-Rex realizing the tracker the staff put inside her was actually a tracking device, like I can buy the idea that she could feel it &amp; would remove it from herself if she felt annoyed by it, but I don’t know how she would as easily come to the conclusion that it was being used to track her.

Overall that’s what I think about the movie, I enjoyed my time watching it &amp; would probably watch it again at some point if I felt like it. I hope you guys appreciate my “analysis” of sorts haha 😛. Although I’m a bit worried that I might get lots of flak from people who don’t appreciate my opinion that much.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I Liked seeing the Dinosaur’s just being themselves in the movie &amp;amp; especially seeing the original T-Rex “Rexy” back again, I still get chills seeing her walk out of her enclosure towards the flare where she then attacks the I-Rex and it’s just nice to see her again :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also think the movies is very well paced, but could have used some more scenes that I wish weren’t removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I liked how the movie took itself fairly seriously from start to finish &amp;amp; even had some mildly gory death scenes which I’m surprised that they got away with. It’s very in-line with what we got in the previous movies. Like I remember my little sister got traumatized watching this in theaters, especially when the character Zara died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the soundtrack by Micheal Gichino is pretty good to listen too, &amp;amp; I still listen to it at points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I though the satirical commentary about how the I-Rex is basically a metaphor for Hollywood capitalism I thought was clever as it basically attacks &amp;amp; goes around killing the dinosaurs &amp;amp; was was only created to be a short term spectacle, which is reminiscent of Hollywood studios basically changing something to where it’s seemingly unrecognizable from what it originally was for short term monetary profits. But it also adds some complexity to the I-Rex as it never asked to be born and was pretty much made to be a spectacle which is a bit tragic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all there’s a lot I liked about the movie, but now I’ll discuss some things I didn’t like. Which luckily isn’t as big as this list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Negatives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a Deleted scene involving the two boys that would have happened when they end up finding the old visitor center &amp;amp; walk into the garage with the old jeeps, where they basically would have just sat down/relaxed as they’d been chased around up until that point in the movie, where they would have talked and that whole divorcement storyline would have been addressed to where the little kid “grey” would have talked about how he was excited for this trap because he thinks this is one of the last times he would have gotten to interact with his brother as they would have been separated due to there parents divorcing, &amp;amp; how grey was “annoying” his older brother Zach because he just wanted to spend time with him and not just be alone and away from him for the rest of his life. Which could have caused Zach to go through a character change, which would have given him a motivation to fix up the old Jeep so they can escape back to the park. I wish this was kept in as it would have been a nice quieter part f the movie focused on the characters. Also it would explain where Al the random water puddles in the parks main street would have came from as it would be raining in the scene for ambient effect. Not to mention it would have acted as foreshadowing to the ending of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, as during there conversation Grey would have said something along the lines of “so this is what a world with dinosaurs would be like? People who are worried &amp;amp; scared about what will happen.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought the movie had a few moments that I feel felt a bit forced, such as the I-Rex realizing the tracker the staff put inside her was actually a tracking device, like I can buy the idea that she could feel it &amp;amp; would remove it from herself if she felt annoyed by it, but I don’t know how she would as easily come to the conclusion that it was being used to track her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall that’s what I think about the movie, I enjoyed my time watching it &amp;amp; would probably watch it again at some point if I felt like it. I hope you guys appreciate my “analysis” of sorts haha 😛. Although I’m a bit worried that I might get lots of flak from people who don’t appreciate my opinion that much. Also if anyones curious about anything feel free to ask me questions.&lt;/p&gt;

,CasualConversation,"Long story short:

When I (23F) was 15 my parents sent me to study abroad. I've finished high school here, and currently doing my master's in uni + working full-time a corporate job. I live alone and I'm super used to it ngl.

My parents plan on sending my younger brother to study here as well next year. And naturally I'm going to take care of him, we're gonna live together and all.

I'll be 24 and he'll be 15.

I feel kinda bad for taking it as a bit of a burden (I'll JUST get out of uni, my free 20s...🥲). But that's family so it is how it is. I do love him and my little sister a lot, it's just hard to imagine taking responsibility for him to such extent. 

But then again, 15 is not that young, he could take care of himself. My parents will definitely be on alert, sustaining him financially, parenting him and all.

It can also be a big opportunity for me to finally really befried him, yk? Like, watching anime together sounds fun! 

But then I remember myself at that age and oof... first times drinking, partying, getting into trouble.... i went off the rails fast since I was abroad alone with no supervision. And I'm the diligent one....
Idk how I'll handle it if my baby brother gets into this teenage rebel stage.

I picture myself finishing whatever activity or event I&amp;#39;m going to and even wish it was later that night where I&amp;#39;m laying in bed and going to sleep and the feeling over comfort that comes with it. It&amp;#39;s not exactly that I&amp;#39;m not &amp;quot;living in the moment&amp;quot; or feeling like I&amp;#39;m not, it&amp;#39;s just sort of like a tired and unexciting feeling. Does anyone else experience this? Is it depression or something else?&lt;/p&gt;

Growing up nothing I did was right in my mom's eyes. I wasn't walking right, my stride was too manly. I couldn't sit right because i tend to sway unconsciously. I was a terrible student because i didn't study right despite straight As. I was lazy because I liked to lay in bed and read after school even though i was on a swim team and swimming 4 to 5 miles a day. I was always eating too much even though I wasn't allowed to eat more food than my mom ate at each meal. I was never eating healthy enough even though my mom provided all my food. My hair was never done right. I could go on and on.

My dad was always a good dad when he parented but he was quiet a lot and traveled a lot for work. I think he felt like he was a lesser parent and had less of a say in how we were raised because he was out of town quite a bit. So he was a good dad but a bit absent. 

I moved out of my parents house and made sure to call everyday. I got tired of doing everything wrong in my mom's eyes.

,CasualConversation,"Over the years I have been collecting so many music it’s kinda getting to the point of ‘too much to handle’. And I’d love to simplify things right now, but I don’t really know where to start. So I was wondering what other people do, and maybe get some inspiration from that. 

ALL SONGS: I currently create a monthly playlist (feat. the music that came out or that I found in that month, that I like). Eventually, after 12 months I bundle those into 1 playlist of that year (containing around 1750-2250 songs every year). 

BEST SONGS: In addition, I also create a monthly &amp; yearly playlist with the music I love from that year. Such that the bigger playlist is thinned out and more listenable. 

LIBRARY: All of these songs (from the bigger playlist) I then try to filter into their respective genres. Think about: Hip Hop, Rock, Indie, Pop… By the way, this is already a simplified version as I initially categorized them into some of their subgenres too: Rap, RnB, Soul… for example. But this has been taking up way too much time that I don’t have anymore. And I always get too perfectionistic about it such that I will look up which genre a song is to add it to the correct playlist and so on. All while thinking that genres are very subjective lol. 

Feel free to suggest some ways to simplify this whole thing again, or tell us how you collect and organize your music! Also, I don’t use the ‘Liked songs’ function right now. What do you use it for?

,CasualConversation,"Ok hear me out.

I think suspenders have the potential to serve a new role in modern society with the advent of ""more shit to carry in your pockets""

suspenders already provide many positives:

* faith in your pants
* easy adjustment of where pants sit on your waist
* classy look
* no belt compressing your waist / underbelly

&lt;p&gt;I think suspenders have the potential to serve a new role in modern society with the advent of &amp;quot;more shit to carry in your pockets&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;suspenders already provide many positives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;faith in your pants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;easy adjustment of where pants sit on your waist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;classy look&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;no belt compressing your waist / underbelly&lt;/p&gt;

So as the title says I’m weighing the pros and cons of my current job to see if it’s worth staying in. 

The pros are it’s full time and just 3 days a week. The schedule rotates but I always get Sunday off and the others change every 4 week. The pay is $5/hour higher than most jobs with my skill set. Another pro is my team is amazing. I love the people I work with and am treating well. The work is also extremely east. I can leave each day with almost no stress. 

So why would I quit? So the part I am struggling with is I print junk mail for a living. Everything from credit card offers to consolidation loan envelopes. My working week is dedicating to convincing people that they don’t have enough and supporting the credit card industry.

What do I want to do? I want to enact real change in my community. I currently volunteer and engage with city government but feel like maybe taking the pay cut and starting on the ground level in a government or nonprofit would be more fulfilling. All I want to do is help people and my current job doesn’t give me an outlet to do that.

,CasualConversation,"As we walk through museums and admire the artifacts on display, it's easy to forget that these objects were once owned and used by real people. We often fail to imagine what it would have been like to live in the same world as the people who created these artifacts, to talk to them, to share their experiences. Even though we're separated by time and distance, we share commonalities with those who came before us.

It's a curious thing, really, to think about how similar we might be to those who lived hundreds or even thousands of years ago. What would it be like to sit down to a meal with someone from the 5th century or to chat with a Scottish lady from the 17th century? Despite the differences in our circumstances, there is a sense of familiarity that bridges the gap between the past and the present.

The repetitive nature of history also serves as a reminder of our connection to the past. We may be separated by centuries, but the same struggles and triumphs continue to play out in different contexts. Example. whether it's a modern woman living in the 21st century or an aristocratic lady of high English society from the past, there is a shared experience of living in a patriarchal society. Despite the differences in our lives and timelines, the struggle against sexism and the limitations placed on women is something that persists through time.

,CasualConversation," I believe The first thing that makes this film unique is the world of Pandora we stepped into. What I really liked about the film is the way James Cameron built the world of Pandora and the reflection of our world, Earth.   


There are a few clear points that I think he wants to say throughout this film.   


***environment and nature:***   
Cameron himself is an environmentalist. The way he portrays the destruction of Nature was heartfelt. He cares about nature and he wants us to care about it too by showing the visuals of the destruction.   


It also may be possible that Cameron wants to give us the message that it's we who should adopt the way of nature and not the other way around. While trying to fix things ultimately we are destroying nature. And it has consequences.   


The way 'kiri' connects with nature and water and all the other things, and she observes and absorbs with them, felt like Cameron wants us to do the same.   


***Family:***   
The film starts with 'Jake's narration about family and love. The transformation of his character as a father is amazing to see. When he says ""A father protects. It’s what gives him meaning"" is something we can relate to,  
 the way 'Jake' leaves the forest to protect his family, somehow depict the thoughts of us humans.   


Also, this film portrays the father-children relationship pretty well. Like 'Lo'ak' trying to be a perfect son and in the end realizing he really can't be a perfect son. And even 'spider' and 'Quaritch' relationship, even after seeing his father ( well technically he is his father) doing all those horribly cruel things, he saved his life in the end.   


***Immigration:***   
When 'Jake' leaves with his family for Awa'atlu, it somehow shows the reality of immigration to another country. we have to learn everything from the beginning to survive there, the same way 'Jake' and his family learn to live in the sea   


***Reflections and detailing:***   
Pandora itself a reflection of Earth. As far as my research is concerned all the things of Pandora is the reflection of Earth. You can see these things mentioned below. 

  
Glowworm Caves, New Zealand.  
Northern Lights.  
Bioluminescent Lagoon, Jamaica.  
Zhangjiajie National Forest Park, China.  
Wisteria Tree at the Ashikaga Flower Park, Ashikaga, Japan.  


'Metkayina' reflects the Bajau Tribe based in Southeast Asia.   


'Tulkun' reflects the whale.  
Even the harpoon used to kill the 'tulkun' is or was exists in real life..  


I found out that Japan is the only country that openly hunts whales these days, and didn't accept the laws of the international whaling commission, and in the film, the ship which was carrying the Harpoon and killed the Tulkun, it's name was written in Japanese and the color was the same of the Japanese flag.   


***Spirituality:***    
'The way of water has no beginning and no end. The sea is around you and in you. The sea is your home before your birth and after your death. The sea gives and the sea takes. Water connects all things.'   
I believe in these lines he is describing our consciousness, I don't want to go into detail, but This is a just perception of mine, I'm leaving it to you.. here's another quote that made my belief more strongly about this ""All energy is borrowed and someday you have to give it back""   


***Cinematography:***   
I don't really have the analysis capabilities that i can judge the cinematography of this film. Russell Carpenter :) :)   


***The world of Pandora:***   
 Cameron put us in the world of Pandora again, he made us feel that Pandora exists, and because of those beautiful visuals, we get connected with the world emotionally as we are connected with this world of ours. It is a simple story yet has so many layers within itself that allow us to connect with the characters and the environment.  and if you think the story is simple and boring so in my opinion In Avatar **""The world itself is the story.""**",t2_a4uvmop3,False,,0,False,I watched 'Avatar 2' yesterday and here's what I think about it..,"[{'a': ':film:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/w3fd7r5sca801_t5_323oy/film'}, {'e': 'text', 't': ' Movies &amp; Shows'}]",r/CasualConversation,False,6,,0,,False,t3_12ipm0u,False,light,0.86,,public,5,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},:film: Movies &amp; Shows,False,5,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1681231388.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.CasualConversation,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe The first thing that makes this film unique is the world of Pandora we stepped into.

,CasualConversation,"Hi Reddit—

I’m looking for a bit of advice. I just received an offer for a job working on an agent’s desk at an artists agency. The pay is fine, although I would have to work overtime each week in order to make sure I’m earning a livable wage for my city.

I left another corporate job in January after two years of working there — it was also in arts administration, though it was working in marketing for a publisher, so I imagine this potential role will be really different day-to-day. Possibly more stressful? Not sure.

The main rub is that I left the other job earlier this year to pursue the arts myself. At the end of the day, I’d like to be represented BY an agency, rather than work for one. But I have more years of work to put in, I think, before I get to the point of having representation. The desk I would be working on is in the area I’m most interested in working in in the future.

Right now, I work three part time jobs to make ends meet. It’s attractive to me to be able to collapse that down to only worrying about one job, although it will be a much more intense single job than any of the part time jobs I work. One of the people I work for now has a book coming out soon and might need support through that launch, so I’m thinking that if I do take the agency job, I could negotiate the start date to be after his book launches.

What do you guys think? Should I take the job? Or what should I be asking myself to know if I should take it?

I just wanted to post this somewhere because this has been the weirdest expierience watching both of these series. Basically none of my friends or people I know have seen succession AND the newest John Wick so I just wanted to post this here. 

I watched the original John Wick back in 2017, so naturally I bought a ticket to the newest one basically imidiatly. I watched it with friends on Friday night, and it was a masterpiece. 

Then, last night, after finishing up some homework I watched the newest episode of Succession. I remember distinctly thinking ""huh, aren't wedding episodes like a season finale thing? Maybe they're dropping it in episode 3 because no one cares about Connor. And then I watched the episode and it shattered me into pieces.

,CasualConversation,"It's crazy how much music can affect your thinking and by extension your entire life.

In college I had sort of an inkling of this. I had a specially curated ""Lift"" playlist for working out, and I specifically picked angry and motivating songs that would help me power through the workout. I was consciously picking songs that would alter my mood in such a way that would be more effective at working out, and I always swore to people that the right song would make you 25% stronger when lifting weights.

Recently I had the idea to make a ""Neutral"" playlist of music. By Neutral I mean only songs with unemotional, basic, non-diatonic songs, songs that specifically are chosen to NOT elicit emotions in me. If I find myself feeling any negative emotions while listening to a song, it's out. WOW. I had no idea that taking such a simple step of making a playlist would change my life so much. By just having a constant mix of ""neutral"" music on in the background, I have found myself with more energy, a more positive mood, less negative thoughts, and more motivation to work on projects. For YEARS I have struggled with motivation and positive thinking. Who would have thought that simply changing the noises in my life could have such a huge effect?

,CasualConversation,"Hello! I'm just some average nobody, with a decent-paying corporate job, a STEM degree, in a major metro area. I do my job well, I get along with my coworkers, I get good performance reviews, and I occasionally get to hang out with some friends. I go to church on Sundays, and have no debt. Sounds great, right?

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, I miss my family. I moved a \~400 miles away from a small town in the country (but not horribly small, \~60k people), and now I only get to see them about a half-dozen times a year. There's a lot of people back home I miss, and I just feel a bit... lost... in the ""big city"". My job is pretty stressful, and I think it's made me realize that after waking up day after day already stressed out, with no real support system here, what really matters in life - family. I'm also not a fan of the concrete jungle, I like the outdoors, riding ATVs, and generally not drowning in traffic everywhere I go. I really don't like living in a $1500, one-bedroom apartment. What I really want is a 2000sqft house, on an acre of land, with a workshop in the back. That's just not possible here, both by average tiny lot size and the insane cost of housing. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been looking at jobs back home, which is a bit harder than finding a job around here. My hometown doesn't have a large presence in my career field, but they do exist, and luckily I've been referred into a promising position. I've been told that they plan to interview me soon, after they fill another high-priority position first. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think it goes against the norm these days to want to move closer to family rather than away, especially when that involves putting my career second. Realistically, I want to move somewhere with a lower cost of living, and generally just not be part of the rat race like I am now.

I&amp;#39;m just some average nobody, with a decent-paying corporate job, a STEM degree, in a major metro area. I do my job well, I get along with my coworkers, I get good performance reviews, and I occasionally get to hang out with some friends. I go to church on Sundays, and have no debt. Sounds great, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is, I miss my family. I moved a ~400 miles away from a small town in the country (but not horribly small, ~60k people), and now I only get to see them about a half-dozen times a year. There&amp;#39;s a lot of people back home I miss, and I just feel a bit... lost... in the &amp;quot;big city&amp;quot;. My job is pretty stressful, and I think it&amp;#39;s made me realize that after waking up day after day already stressed out, with no real support system here, what really matters in life - family. I&amp;#39;m also not a fan of the concrete jungle, I like the outdoors, riding ATVs, and generally not drowning in traffic everywhere I go. I really don&amp;#39;t like living in a $1500, one-bedroom apartment. What I really want is a 2000sqft house, on an acre of land, with a workshop in the back. That&amp;#39;s just not possible here, both by average tiny lot size and the insane cost of housing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been looking at jobs back home, which is a bit harder than finding a job around here. My hometown doesn&amp;#39;t have a large presence in my career field, but they do exist, and luckily I&amp;#39;ve been referred into a promising position. I&amp;#39;ve been told that they plan to interview me soon, after they fill another high-priority position first. &lt;/p&gt;

From there we started talking and sat together in the train talking about us, what we do, interests and making small talk etc for a couple hours until we had to de-board. I asked her for her phone number when we parted ways.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been texting since then in-between. She lives in a city 500 kms away and seems to come to my city a few times a year. But haha here&amp;#39;s the problem, since she lives far away there&amp;#39;s no way for me to ask her for a date. So, what do I do with this situation now ? :) I would love to get to know her better but Im afraid being so far apart, the texting will slowly stop.&lt;/p&gt;

,CasualConversation,"When I was deployed to the Middle East in 2018, I knew I had a long plane ride before I ever got in country.

On a whim, I purchased a Rubik's Cube. I figured it couldn't possibly be that hard, and I had a 16 hour flight to figure it out. I vastly overestimated my abilities. While I could solve the white face, but I couldn't figure out how to insert the edge pieces over the corners. 

While waiting in a terminal after the first leg, my friend asked to see the Rubik's Cube so he could show me how to solve it. He did so, and he asked me if I ""caught all that."" Of course, I hadn't, but it motivated me even more so to pursue solving it. 

I googled basic algorithms, and screen-shotted them. I spent the remaining flight time establishing an understanding of solving the ""first two layers."" But I struggled with the yellow face.

Before long, I found myself in Kuwait, waiting for yet another flight. Another friend approached me, and reinforced the method I had been practicing for the better part of a day. But he also taught me how to solve the last pieces of the cube - the remaining corners that you seemingly have to destroy all your progress to solve. Maybe there's a life lesson in there?

Then I boarded my flight to Afghanistan. 

People often say that war isn't like the movies, but I do tend to disagree - at least regarding contemporary films like The Outpost, Fury and We Were Soldiers. It's a lot of boredom followed by very intense periods of fear and adrenaline. The Rubik's Cube prevented boredom, but it was also an outlet when you needed to escape the chaos.

That Rubik's Cube, was it's own little world. It was order. It was something that could be controlled. Before long, my fellow troops were learning to solve it. Some to stave off boredom, others wanted to learn because they saw me doing it. I think we all liked that it let us take back a little control in our lives.

We began to race each other as best we could. We'd time one another, and I think the fastest anyone ever got on that thing was about 1:10. We thought we were Gods. 

We even began to introduce higher order puzzles like the 5x5 and megaminx. New challenges to overcome; new opportunities to restore order.

Through all the chaos, we always came back to these cubes. They provided a reprieve from the day-to-day; a minute of distraction from an environment we were unwelcome in.

Even now, struggling with my PTSD, anxiety and stress, I come back to the Rubik's Cube. 

So what has the Rubik's Cube done for me? It's given me thousands of opportunities to restore order in my head, if only for a moment. It's provided me thousands of brief respites from how harsh life can be.

Even though I can solve it in twenty seconds now, it still has a vast well of techniques, tricks and algorithms to learn. More mysteries to uncover.

Moreover, it helps me connect with people; I've lost count of the number of people I have taught to solve it. It helps me see the tangible impact we all have on those around us.

So fast forward today, my sis just passed her quiz test for driver’s license and she just received her permit to practice, and Ive been stressed on getting a car because Im afraid I am losing my knowledge to drive.

So one day I researched and Ive stumbled on this car sharing in my city: which I always ignored because I always supposed the fees were high. Little to know fees are low. € 0,29 per minute. So it was my ticket into relearning how to drive. One night I brought my sis to drive the car for the first time again. It was good, I still can drive but… I had the hand brake up all the time. 

Second time was better, and I also let my sis drive to learn how to use clutch.

We all have the ability to be anything, to do anything, we just have to do it.


One, we all get one life, think about it, ONE. And most of us aren’t even happy? 


Whats the purpose of living a miserable life doing the things you hate.


We’re all clouded from the masses, where we try to fit in, make sure to say the right thing. Trying our best not to be judged.


Who gives a fuck?


It’s literally a pointless psychological battle we inflict on ourselves.


Pain is inevitable, the pain and discipline of doing great things. And the pain and regret from not doing things.


Worry consumes time. Just think about the regret if you don’t do the thing NOW.



Why are you letting that thing bother you so much? Just stop thinking about it.




You regretting that one thing, should be a tell tale to not take time for granted.



Why do you seek approval of others?




We spend the majority of time in our heads, in a second world, a world of regret and worry.




We chase things that ultimately won’t matter when we pass. That should tell you something. The fact that nothing gets carried over in the transition to the afterlife. Why chase?



You’re controlled by lust.



Are you really dumb? Or see you letting others frame the way you think about yourself.


We love ourselves more than anybody else yet we care more about what other people think.



Most of us die not living a life fullfilled, missed so much on opportunity and chance. All because we were scared.



We live a life immersed in screens, we are so diverted from reality. 


We are staring at the world through a screen, when all we have to do is look up.



You wasted so much time being heartbroken, literally another person affected your life. It’s silly.



Nothing external can hurt you. Anything that hurts is your fault. Because internally you allowed yourself to perceive something as hurtful. Just pay no mind.



Did you get the latest clothing? Did you get the latest phone? Are you up to date on slang, are you keeping up with trends? Are you doing good in this social hierarchy?

All Nonsense 




Nobody knows the meaning of life, yet we yell, condemn, and judge? Who are we to pose that authority? Everyone is a mirrored you. Maybe a different name, maybe a different color, maybe a different gender? But they eat, drink, breathe like you?

,CasualConversation,"It's like a ritual.

Get the essentials bag ready, put on your favorite band tee that matches the genre if you don't already have merch from them. Pack light and don't forget the hydration.

I've been to several dozens of festivals/concerts before, everything ranging from rap to edm to indie and back round again. The volume of the music, the energy of the crowd, the camaraderie of being with your brothers and sisters in the thick of musical bliss.

I've seen drama unfold, people get kicked out, almost got kicked out myself, and the moshing. The wonderful moshing. I had a ticket to go see a set, no big names in particular, just an event with some guys playing some classic early to late 00s angsty music, the kind that you used to listen to in the car and got the inspiration to dye your hair like Gerard Way because you thought you could pull it off.

They started playing some metal in the mix. Couldn't tell you the band, may have been As I Lay Dying. I felt the irresistible urge to jump head long into a mosh pit. Nothing new to me, I am a little bit on the skinnier side so I do take it easy until I get a feel for it, can't really throw my weight around. 

Now I am by no means young, but I haven't hit the threshold for being *""old""* yet. The shoving began and I was getting tossed around like I was in some human shaped blender. Event ends and I manage to make it home.

The day after, the adrenaline of the night before had worn off, and it felt like my entire body felt like it was being torn apart by razor wire. Someone had stepped on my foot with combat boots on and I am now very obviously walking with a limp. My face has a few minor cuts and a portion of my leg has a serious looking bruise.

&lt;p&gt;Get the essentials bag ready, put on your favorite band tee that matches the genre if you don&amp;#39;t already have merch from them. Pack light and don&amp;#39;t forget the hydration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been to several dozens of festivals/concerts before, everything ranging from rap to edm to indie and back round again. The volume of the music, the energy of the crowd, the camaraderie of being with your brothers and sisters in the thick of musical bliss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen drama unfold, people get kicked out, almost got kicked out myself, and the moshing. The wonderful moshing. I had a ticket to go see a set, no big names in particular, just an event with some guys playing some classic early to late 00s angsty music, the kind that you used to listen to in the car and got the inspiration to dye your hair like Gerard Way because you thought you could pull it off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They started playing some metal in the mix. Couldn&amp;#39;t tell you the band, may have been As I Lay Dying. I felt the irresistible urge to jump head long into a mosh pit. Nothing new to me, I am a little bit on the skinnier side so I do take it easy until I get a feel for it, can&amp;#39;t really throw my weight around. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I am by no means young, but I haven&amp;#39;t hit the threshold for being &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;old&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; yet. The shoving began and I was getting tossed around like I was in some human shaped blender. Event ends and I manage to make it home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day after, the adrenaline of the night before had worn off, and it felt like my entire body felt like it was being torn apart by razor wire. Someone had stepped on my foot with combat boots on and I am now very obviously walking with a limp. My face has a few minor cuts and a portion of my leg has a serious looking bruise. My only thoughts? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best. Night. Ever. 🤘&lt;/p&gt;

Below are some of the questions I am looking for answers on, if anyone can contribute it'd be appreciated!

	1	Why do F1 fans tend to flock to Reddit opposed to other platforms?
	2	What kind of information is shown in the televised event (pre-show, qualifying, race, interviews) and what can you learn about the drivers from only this perspective? Do you have more power as a spectator at a race live? Less constrained by producers’ choices and sometimes untrue narratives e.g., Carlos Sainz getting no camera time
	3	What knowledge do you gain from the subreddits? How does this information affect the way you watch F1 races, if at all?
	4	What are the unnamed rules of the subreddits, what is not allowed to be talked about? (other than the obvious, racism, unkind behaviour)
	5	When do you check the subreddits, what type of mood are you in when you check them, do you check them more often pre, post, or during a race?
	6	What are the conflicts other than driver vs. driver or team vs. team? What divides F1 fans on reddit?
	7	How do flairs affect the subreddits, what would happen if they were taken away?
	8	How can you tell if someone is a “real” fan on Reddit, what singles you out, and how do you think remaining anonymous affects everything and who has the most credibility?
	9	Is the conversation to be had on the subreddits deep and meaningful?

,CasualConversation,"The  reason that I say I think is because it's not like this was  preplanned... and I can't read minds. So maybe he didn't know his  actions and behvours can result in a fight? While I doubt it... it's  possible.

So, my wife and I were  at the store the other day when I hear ""Pull your damn pants up. Pull  your FUCKING PANTS UP!"" from off to my left pretty far behind me.At  first, I didn't react, not thinking it was directed at me, but pretty  quickly I reached back and, yep, the very top of my butt crack was  showing.

I turn around intending  to say sorry, as I was embarrassed, but by the time I'm fully turned  around, this man is actually waking towards Cynthia and I. And he's  still repeating, ""Pull your fucking pants up!"" 

A good defensive position to take, and the one that I took,is to simply raise your hands: Making  sure your fingers are spread out (in case you need to grab), raise your  hands to right about shoulder height. You're trying to put your hands  at the same height as your sholder blades behind them.  
Secondly, your hands should be a little bit out from your body. I suggest four to six inches.  
The  person in question that caused you to take this stance should not be  allowed to get close enough to actually touch your hand.

So  I'm standing there with my hands up and out and I'm trying to tell this  dude ""Hey, no problem, I'm sorry for the mistake"" but he's not hearing  me.He gets about two and a half feet away and my wife steps out in front of him with her arms wide out. She tells him ""back off. He's tired, he didn't think about it, it's fixed.""I've  already talked to her about the fact that while I appreciate her doing  that, I would prefer her not to put herself in danger for me. She's very  brave, though.After she repeats that a couple of times, the dude smiles and turns around..

&lt;p&gt;A good defensive position to take, and the one that I took,is to simply raise your hands: Making  sure your fingers are spread out (in case you need to grab), raise your  hands to right about shoulder height. You&amp;#39;re trying to put your hands  at the same height as your sholder blades behind them.&lt;br/&gt;
Secondly, your hands should be a little bit out from your body. I suggest four to six inches.&lt;br/&gt;
The  person in question that caused you to take this stance should not be  allowed to get close enough to actually touch your hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So  I&amp;#39;m standing there with my hands up and out and I&amp;#39;m trying to tell this  dude &amp;quot;Hey, no problem, I&amp;#39;m sorry for the mistake&amp;quot; but he&amp;#39;s not hearing  me.He gets about two and a half feet away and my wife steps out in front of him with her arms wide out. She tells him &amp;quot;back off. He&amp;#39;s tired, he didn&amp;#39;t think about it, it&amp;#39;s fixed.&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve  already talked to her about the fact that while I appreciate her doing  that, I would prefer her not to put herself in danger for me. She&amp;#39;s very  brave, though.After she repeats that a couple of times, the dude smiles and turns around..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was just such a strange encounter, you know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are your thoughts on this? :D&lt;/p&gt;

,CasualConversation,"My boyfriend has 3 pairs of the same pants that he wears every day. They're just plain black pants. He also has 3 pairs of the exact same shoes. When I asked him about them, he said ""I just like them, so I bought pairs so I always have some even if they're in the wash basket"". Ok, fine.

But then he does things like put ice cubes in his food. He says ""When the food is too hot to eat I put them in to cool it down, just like drinks"". I've seen him put them in mashed potato, soup, coffee, and I've seen him put ice cubes in a small plastic bag and place it on top of pizza. Nobody else does that, right?

Speaking of food, he eats a shitload of lettuce. He will just pick a leaf off and crunch on it, 3-5 times a day.

When he is sick, he sleeps in the bathtub. I guess this is a comfort thing which I can understand, but it's still a bit odd.

He owns a slingshot and **keeps it in his pocket**, and sets up targets around his house. When he's walking about, he pulls out his slingshot randomly and spins and fires, hitting the target. He has very good accuracy, but why in the house? The little metal balls that he fires end up on the floor and hurt like a bitch if you stand on them, they're everywhere.

His mail comes through in many different names, he says it's for privacy. ""When I sign up to places I give a fake name so if I get junk mail, I know who did it"". But he doesn't write any of the names down, so he can't remember which names relate to which companies, completely defeating the purpose! And when spam callers ring, he will derail the conversation and try to talk to them about their life.

Every time there's a thunderstorm, he runs outside into the rain to spectate, regardless of what he is wearing.

I feel like these would be red flags, but the guy is charming and I love his quirks.

Let me tell you a little bit about myself.  I can light up a room with positive energy, make people feel heard, have friendly conversations, help people discover their natural talents/skills.

 I'm also quite talented in a number of skills, I can write, design, create content, carry out research, manage social media pages, I'm basically a one-person army. But despite my many talents, I can't seem to catch a break. I don't like breaking down, but sometimes I get to overwhelmed not to.

I love putting my skills to use. It makes me feel alive and purposeful. But when I'm not making any money, it's hard to stay motivated. It's like I'm constantly banging my head against a brick wall. No matter how hard I try, I just can't seem to break through.

I'm not alone in this struggle, of course. There are many people out there who are just like me, trying to make a living doing what they love.

It's not just about the money. It's about the satisfaction of doing something that I love and being paid for it. It's about having the freedom to choose the projects that I work on and the clients that I work with.

In a way, it's a journey of love, frustration, and hunger. Love for what I do, frustration at the difficulties of finding clients, and hunger for success and recognition.

So I'll keep on hustling, keep on putting myself out there, and keep on doing what I love.

,CasualConversation,"I know how to read and have read some stuff, but have never read an actual complete novel all the way through before. I do read some manga and graphic novels and have listened to a couple audio books but that's pretty much it

I have adhd so I can get pretty bored if im just sitting in one spot for a while, and I also have dyslexia which makes it kinda difficult for me to read these huge pages full of small text in the first place, so I kinda just never read but it's super embarrassing for me to tell people or if someone asks what my favorite book is and I don't have an answer 😭

BUT I found a book in my dads library that I think I'll actually be able to read and ngl im actually really excited 😁😁

It's Journey to the Center of the Earth by Jules Verne. It's actually kind of perfect because it's a pretty short stand alone book (i think) so I don't have to make a huge commitment and im less likely to get bored

&lt;p&gt;I have adhd so I can get pretty bored if im just sitting in one spot for a while, and I also have dyslexia which makes it kinda difficult for me to read these huge pages full of small text in the first place, so I kinda just never read but it&amp;#39;s super embarrassing for me to tell people or if someone asks what my favorite book is and I don&amp;#39;t have an answer 😭&lt;/p&gt;

I have a big family and being in a big family means that there is almost always a few kids. And that means every year for every major gift or food based holiday that’s marketed towards kids, we have some kind of setup for the house.

For Christmas, the Santa gift is set up and ready to be played with immediately along with your stocking next to it to show its yours.

 I told her its not available anymore. She said thats okay she will keep looking for another one. At first I thought that she will put down the phone but she said she hates technology and never wanted a computer in the first place.

She is sick and she cant travel anymore. A drive from my country to the town is normally around 8h, because of the war, travelling is hard right now.

She told me how much opportunities she had, living in a big city but she wants to be in isolation again, she fears progression and the fact that her family is so far away.

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the phone call, I honestly told her that I hope we can talk again some day. The conversation with her was so refreshing and really made my day. I learned a lot in those 5 hours. And I am happy that I got to spend my time with this interesting person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you deal with a receding hairline?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have a go-to simple hairstyle for hiding it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does it bother you? (It bothers me a lot because I&amp;#39;m supposed to be young and this makes me look old, at least that&amp;#39;s what others say)&lt;/p&gt;

,CasualConversation,"Since I was a kid, about ten years old maybe, I've always loved looking at the stars, Moon, the planets, and anything space related. While camping two weekends ago I saw the most beautiful view of the night sky I've ever seen in my life at 38 years old. I was out camping with two of my friends in New River Gorge National Park and we had the most favorable weather and viewing conditions you could ask for despite the forecast predicting lots of clouds. There were plenty of clouds throughout the day that made the Sun seem as if it was playing ""peek-a-boo"" but they eventually retreated entirely shortly before dusk like the sky was ready for its curtain call. And it was preparing to put on a beautiful show.

Our campsite was nestled on an old, washed out sandbar deep in a valley flanked on all sides by tall hills and adjacent to the ancient New River which has carved into the Appalachian Mountains for millennia. The mountainous hills around us, although not tell by Rocky Mountain standards, still rose to a high enough altitude to block a significant portion of our view of the sky around us while still leaving us with a spectacular sliver of space. The conditions for viewing the night sky were perfect since there wasn't a cloud in the sky, the Moon was but a small sliver of light low above the mountains, and an absence of light pollution save for the soft glow of the campfire. I was the first to notice Venus shining brightly even in the quickly fading amber sunset that was left hanging close to the Moon. My friends questioned me, ""how do you know that's Venus?"" and I explained to them how low it is over the horizon, how bright it is compared to everything else, and how it doesn't twinkle like stars do. With no cellular service to Google it, they took my word for it. 

Within an hour or so all sunlight was gone and darkness filled the entire valley revealing star after star after star. I pointed out different constellations to my friends including my favorite one, Orion. We sat and chilled for a couple hours constantly glancing at the amazing show above our heads until the both of them turned in for the night. Forever a night owl, I stayed up for a couple hours more taking in the sky by myself sitting next to the campfire keeping going during the chilly low-to-mid-40's night and a lantern if I needed it. When I finally let the fire die I was enveloped in some of the darkest darkness I can remember. The darkness was mixed with an eery quietness with the only sound coming from the rapids of the New River creating a nice white noise to help go to sleep. There were no crickets, frogs, or other creatures making noise since it was too early for them to be active. There was an occasional train rolling through the tracks on the other side of the river hundreds of yards away that was pulling cars for hauling coal which were full when heading in one direction and empty heading back. With no railroad crossings close by the train didn't blow its horn but we could still hear is coming from a mile or more away. 

But that's the story of the most beautiful night sky I've ever seen.

,CasualConversation,"Heyy Reddit

I've been renting a house for about 3 years now, since 2020. I am a single parent, and have to take care of basically everything like yard  matience and gutter cleaning. 

I lived in houses my whole life, I never lived in an apartment until I got my first place at 20. This is not because my parents are rich, but because there are not really any apartments in rural Canada in the 1990s. Many time I've herd discussions about how terrible condos and apartments are for sharing walls/spaces. When I was 20 I moved into a city and was pumped to be in an apartment.

Life moved on and I became a parent, and at 26 in 2020 while the housing market skyrocketed I found a house in the county at a cheaper rent then my apartment. My apartment did not have a balcony or any outside space. I went from that to a 3 bedroom house with a fenced in yard. I got an electric lawnmower and figured I'd have a blast. It was awesome with covid to take my kid out without having to be sharing space with strangers.

Taking care of a house is so much work. This house is older and not insulated well and all utilities are insane. Cleaning gutters is worse then you think. Having a garden or doing lawn maintenance is physical work, and hard. electric problems, door locking problems, we had an ice storm and trees went down in the back yard and that was all on me to clean. I moved at early covid so no painting or anything outside of emergency services was done to the house before I moved in, and just recently in 2023 had the landlord come in to check the smoke alarms and c02 dectors, and apparently I have no c02 dector. I thought that one of our smoke alarms was a c02 as well. Did they give me one? No. Apparently it is up to me to purchase one, and I was in this house with my child without one for years. In any apartment I've rented men would physically come into my apartment to check the alarms.

I think I am one of the few people who were born in the 2000's and have a fond memory with something as old and boring as a newspaper. My father had a subscription to a newspaper called Al-Ahram ""The pyramids"", he was subscribed to a special edition called ""The Friday Ahram"" which comes with three papers, one for usual news but thicker since it's for the whole week, one for all the news about the cars in Egypt, and a small one with the edition's name. The last one wasn't really for news but for writers, poets and cartoonists. The last two were the ones which peaked my interest. The guy who delivered them would usually come at 9-10 A.M, my dad would take the papers and sit in the living room to read them. Then I would ask him to let me read the other two, he usually didn't mind. I would take them and start reading, the one about cars would get me bored really quickly, it was too analytic for 6-year-old me, I would quickly hop on the other one. It consisted of short stories, poems, and various cartoons that reflects on the life. But little me didn't understand it and didn't care, he was only there for the stories and cartoons that looked both exciting and funny.

,CasualConversation," Ok.  So. 

Step mom texts me about the restaurant she’s at: “food is good but waitress is a ditz” I say everyone has off nights. She says “yeah but she was just not good”. While my dad is texting me separately (they’re both together at the restaurant) and is asking me how to tip the chefs and kitchen staff.

This just pissed me off so badly because I’m almost certain that this poor waitress wasn’t nearly as bad as Sharon said she was. And now she’s making my dad not tip the waitress.  My step mom is a hellish person to be near to. She will make you feel like a piece of dog shit for existing in her presence. And how fucking dare you breathe.  Like that. 

Anyways.  She texts me about the service and my dads texting me separately and I’m just seeing this whole thing play out like two fucking ass holes trying to bully some poor waitress because they’re miserable in their own hearts. (Not my dad, but my step mom is for sure). 

So I wrote this whole thing out. But like. Obviously I’m not going to send it, but I guess I just wanted someone to hear it. Sharon doesn’t even deserve to know what true friendship is. Here’s the text that was never sent, cause what kind of psycho sends this shit:

“Yeah I feel for the waitresses. One time at Hawthornes by my dads old condo where I used to work. It was like my 3rd day and I had a party table of 16 people and simultaneous 2/3/4 tops on the patio and one table inside. Table inside couldn’t see the patio and thought they were the only ones in the restaurant.  The table inside left me a penny as a tip and wrote a scathing note on the bill.  I was so upset and started sobbing as I typed it into the computer in the kitchen. One of the older waitresses saw me and took me out back with the recycling and gave me an empty beer bottle and said “throw it” and we both smashed a couple empty beer bottles on the ground in the dumpster area and hugged it out. She hugged me and told me people are assholes. 

The couple that gave me a $.01 tip came back a month or so later and I was their server again (I recognized them immediately and was like fuck my life) but I treated them well and kept my chin up and they left me a good tip and pulled me aside and said thanks for the good service.  I always think about that when I judge my servers. They’re probably trying so hard and you can’t see the other things they have going on.”

I had even had dreams about going professional for a while, but decided I just didn't have the talent for it and it deeply saddened me.

,CasualConversation,"What is it that makes people so willing to freely divulge personal information to random strangers? Why is it that people will share more with someone they don't know than someone they know? I recently experienced the beauty of this phenomenon twice in two weeks. The first encounter was with an Uber driver, the second with a person on the bus.

For context, I’m 26M and I’ve recently found myself on a journey of self discovery. I’ve been thinking about myself and my past, uncovering dirty truths that I kept bottled away for many years, and learning to reconnect with my emotions. In short, I’m healing my past traumas, and transforming into a new person. I haven’t been seeing a therapist but I have someone else who is very supportive in my life that I think is working even better (love you!).

So, here I am at midnight calling an Uber to go home as I have work the next day. The driver (40M) shows up and I get in the car. It’s about a 15 minute drive, and the driver immediately sparks up a conversation. He calls me by my first name a couple times which shows his interest in engaging with me, so I accept the invitation and we start talking. He asked me about how things are going tonight, and I said, “things are turbulent”. Right away he starts talking about his own life, as if it was about to burst out of his chest and he was just waiting for the right person to come along who was willing to listen.

He told me about a health condition that prevents him from sleeping and causes him daily physical pain, which is why he spends his nights as an Uber driver. He told me about his relationship problems. He told me about the guilt he feels over the way he treated people in the past that were close to him. He told me about his child that died at the age of two. It was painful to listen to. I could tell that he was in a lot of pain, and there was nothing I could do except listen and validate his feelings. Perhaps that’s all he wanted. “Perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to be understood.”

I decided to share my story as well, in short form as we didn’t have much time. I described feeling lost in the world, not knowing who I am or what I want. I explained I didn’t love myself and that I didn’t feel worthy. I explained I felt very ill equipped to deal with all of these new emotions I was feeling that I had previously repressed. These are topics I wouldn’t share even with my own parents… and yet here I am telling a random stranger about my deepest insecurities. But somehow it felt safe. That’s the word I would use…. safe. It felt safe to share because I knew there was nothing he could do with that information to hurt me. There was no baggage between us, no history, and so the dynamic of the conversation was one of brutal honesty.

As we were approaching our destination, I asked my driver one final question: “I feel so overwhelmed. What do I do now? Where do I start?”

He gave me one piece of advice that I’m never going to forget: “Start with one thing. JUST ONE THING! And see it through to the end.”

And that’s been my approach to life ever since. To take it one step at a time, and to deeply explore each individual problem as it comes so that I can gain as many insights as possible about the situation/feeling/whatever it is. How can you ever hope to make a meaningful and lasting change if you don’t understand the thing you’re changing?

The Uber driver gave me his number and just a few days ago I texted him to say hi. We agreed we would go for a coffee sometime… but only when it feels right, which could be months down the road, could be years, I don't know.

There was another encounter with a second person on a bus about a week later. But this post is getting long so I think I will save it for another time. But it was a similar situation, except it was only the other person sharing, and I sat silent and just listened. But the information he shared was just as personal.

,CasualConversation,"I'm 20 in college and it's my birthday soon. My friends from high school invited me to go out with them the weekend after my birthday. However, I feel like I don't really know them anymore. During high school, I wasn't really close with a lot of them and didn't really like them. I didn't hate them, I just never clicked with them. We had different interests and attitudes back then, and still do today. I feel like an asshole though for not wanting to go, but I don't really don't want to. Maybe it'd be cool to catch up with them, but again, I'm not too interested. I haven't seen some of them in 2 years.

I also have midterms right after that weekend and I'm probably going to need that to study.

Argument A: There's a beard trimmer that I really want. It looks great, and I need one, because my beard is usually unkempt. And I'm not allowed to shave it, because according to my wife, I look like I'm about 13 years old without a beard. 

Argument B: That's not really fun. I have a couple toys that I also really want, already picked out and that's about 25% cheaper than the beard trimmer. I already have a nice body hair trimmer that I could use to trim my beard but I choose not to. So:

B1: I could just use my body hair trimmer to fix my beard. Problem is that's not as convenient, or as exciting. And I could have been doing it all along and haven't so...the likelihood that I would do it seems low. But I could!

,CasualConversation,"TL;DR at the end

i was the type of kid that just goofed off, partied, and didnt do jack shit in high school, and my grades reflected that (gpa: ~2.2 IIRC) and i never planned on going to college bc i never thought i could handle it, and i never had any professional passions/aspirations

fast forward to 2020 ive been graduated so im working but then the pandemic hits, i was in trade at the time and my company worked in hospitals so i “got laid off” (they finally reached back to me a few months ago, gee thanks…) so i decided “fuck it” and enrolled in community college. ive been continuing to take classes since, and ive been unemployed throughout this time

fast forward to about a year ago and i was invited to join Phi Theta Kappa, which is the international honors society for community college students. this was the first time in my life id been given an academic honor like this

i still dont feel like i really have an *incredibly* strong goal for my career (ive had a looong history of flip flopping) but ive been drawn towards the general idea of working with computers, and sometimes more specifically adobe software/graphic arts and picture/video editing

my graphic arts artstyle is pretty surreal/bold/non professional though and when i wasnt learning to use these softwares through making art it was through making memes, so i really dont have anything to show off my abilities to employers for that

because of my tendency to flip flop and my lack of a clear vision, i decided to just go for a general studies degree

i only have 1 class left until graduation and im currently in the middle of it, so ive been applying to basically any job thats not service/fast food and in several months time i was only able to land 1 potential interview, which fell through before we got to the in-person stage unfortunately

that was, until i started going through the process of getting hired by the people who actually hired me. 

i applied to be a entry level marketing consultant, and i already felt underqualified for that. BUT APPARENTLY THEY FELT DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE THEY HIRED ME AS A “MANAGER IN TRAINING”

#WHAT????

to be fair, i think the interview went incredibly well. turns out, the guy who was interviewing me (who i believe is going to be my boss) was really into using adobe software as a hobby as well! he said his artstyle was inspired by anime, and that he loves anime. i told him that i intend to continue to grow my skills with adobe as im with the company, whether inside or outside of work, as i intend to one day have a career relating to that, and he seemed to really like the idea.

i am so incredibly underqualified for this position, and i cant wait to start",t2_34h28i17,False,,0,False,"after months of radio silence from employers, i feel like i just hit the jackpot on jobs","[{'a': ':chat:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/04fpiw4fukg21_t5_323oy/chat'}, {'e': 'text', 't': ' Just Chatting'}]",r/CasualConversation,False,6,,0,,False,t3_12eelud,False,light,0.86,,public,5,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},:chat: Just Chatting,False,5,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1680857114.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.CasualConversation,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL;DR at the end&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i was the type of kid that just goofed off, partied, and didnt do jack shit in high school, and my grades reflected that (gpa: ~2.2 IIRC) and i never planned on going to college bc i never thought i could handle it, and i never had any professional passions/aspirations&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;fast forward to 2020 ive been graduated so im working but then the pandemic hits, i was in trade at the time and my company worked in hospitals so i “got laid off” (they finally reached back to me a few months ago, gee thanks…) so i decided “fuck it” and enrolled in community college. ive been continuing to take classes since, and ive been unemployed throughout this time&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;fast forward to about a year ago and i was invited to join Phi Theta Kappa, which is the international honors society for community college students. this was the first time in my life id been given an academic honor like this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i still dont feel like i really have an &lt;em&gt;incredibly&lt;/em&gt; strong goal for my career (ive had a looong history of flip flopping) but ive been drawn towards the general idea of working with computers, and sometimes more specifically adobe software/graphic arts and picture/video editing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;my graphic arts artstyle is pretty surreal/bold/non professional though and when i wasnt learning to use these softwares through making art it was through making memes, so i really dont have anything to show off my abilities to employers for that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;because of my tendency to flip flop and my lack of a clear vision, i decided to just go for a general studies degree&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i only have 1 class left until graduation and im currently in the middle of it, so ive been applying to basically any job thats not service/fast food and in several months time i was only able to land 1 potential interview, which fell through before we got to the in-person stage unfortunately&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;that was, until i started going through the process of getting hired by the people who actually hired me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i applied to be a entry level marketing consultant, and i already felt underqualified for that. BUT APPARENTLY THEY FELT DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE THEY HIRED ME AS A “MANAGER IN TRAINING”&lt;/p&gt;

,CasualConversation,"For those who don't know, Peacock is a streaming service by Comcast that launched July 15th, 2020 and has 20 million subscribers as of writing this. From what I heard, it is kinda useless and that's kinda surprising since Comcast owns Universal and Universal is famous for its great movies.

As for new movies, well movies like Nope have been released to the platform 45 days after the theatrical release... Only to move to another platform like Amazon Prime after 4 months, and then move back to Peacock after ten months to be on it for 4 months again.

Overall, Comcast is missing the opportunity to make it known as ""The Universal streaming service"" by not putting its classic movies or even bad movies like Shark Tale which are being watched on Netflix a lot right now.

,CasualConversation,"I'm currently staying at a small campground while I prepare to move.  Over the few months I've been here there's this guy who lives there and looks kinda intimidating (tattoos, bald, huge beard etc) and I was always nervous about walking past his place.  

One time I was walking past with my pup and he was leaving his trailer and he commented that he was a happy pup, and I was kinda surprised as he was so friendly and not gruff like I expected him to be.  A few weeks later, as Eddy and I were walking past his place again, Eddy saw the park owner/manager and started barking up a storm because he wanted to say hi, and the guy was heading out and stopped to say that I was doing a great job with Eddy and that he was lucky to have me.  It was a small compliment but it really made my week and helped me realize that I was actually doing great with Eddy's training. 

I'm moving soon, so I thought I should make a card for this guy and thank him for his kind words.  I thought it was too much, but I figured I only have one life and if I can do something nice I should do it.  So I made the card (and a few more for other people here that I've met) and I went over.  Let me say here that I was SO nervous, but I knew I'd be upset at myself if I didn't overcome my anxiety about talking to new people so I phsyched myself up and said a prayer and marched over.  

I knocked on the door and he took the card, and then I asked him to sign my book which is a sort of memory scrapbook in which people I've met can write a little note or something for me to remember them by.  He invited me in while he wrote a small note and then we ended up talking for over 30 minutes.   He's actually a super nice guy and he had so many interesting things to share.  I learned about his dogs and his family and kids, and it was just a really great conversation. 

One of the things that I'll always remember from our conversation is what he said about living.  He said: you don't need a lot to be happy, and if you're in a situation that makes you unhappy, take some paper and figure out what it is and find ways to change it.

I just started a work from home job, a few days ago ( maybe a week ago) 
I was still in training 
They fired me due to my dog being “too loud” (he literally whined once and no one heard him cause I asked my trainer and she said she heard nothing) 
And also me calling off one day of work, and working 2 half days. 
My first half day I had a fever of 99 degrees and I didn’t leave until my trainer told me not to overwork myself. 
The second day I called off completely because I was non stop vomiting. 
Today I called off after an hour because I threw up on my desk during training. 

After I filled out the call out form I got a call from one of my bosses and they said they were letting me go because my dog was too loud and distracting customers- catch is? 
I never even got to take a single customer. 

Honestly I don’t blame them and my trainer was PISSED OFF that they fired me for being sick and has told me not to feel guilty but I can’t help but feel like I’ve disappointed my fiancée (M24).

They fired me due to my dog being “too loud” (he literally whined once and no one heard him cause I asked my trainer and she said she heard nothing) 
And also me calling off one day of work, and working 2 half days. 
My first half day I had a fever of 99 degrees and I didn’t leave until my trainer told me not to overwork myself. 
The second day I called off completely because I was non stop vomiting. 
Today I called off after an hour because I threw up on my desk during training. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I filled out the call out form I got a call from one of my bosses and they said they were letting me go because my dog was too loud and distracting customers- catch is? 
I never even got to take a single customer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly I don’t blame them and my trainer was PISSED OFF that they fired me for being sick and has told me not to feel guilty but I can’t help but feel like I’ve disappointed my fiancée (M24).

And though she barely spends a penny on herself, her love language is giving. Meaning she showers me daily with the types of food I could only afford occasionally before; clears my credit card for me each month and we'll be moving to a landed property and getting cars I only could dream about before.

I'm also very excited and nervous because I know my life will be changing quite drastically, but on top of that I will have to heal a broken heart. I knew being an adult was not going to be easy, but not in the ways I expected. It's hard to plan after college, I may just cry the next time someone asks what I'm doing after college, and where I'm moving to. It's hard to know, I have goals I'm going to go for, but I know in the end I'll never know where life will take me, so I don't want to be set in my ways. 

I'm graduating with a graphic design degree, which I'm excited to be doing something in the digital art world. I just wish I knew what to expect in the working world, because I know it's different than college. I'm scared of being stuck in my hometown for awhile after college. I'm pretty sure I have imposter syndrome which isn't helping anything. 

I'm going in a big trip in June which I'm VERY excited for, and I have a hard time admitting this but I feel like I deserve it after how hard I've worked and I deserve a break. Also I don't know how much this will mess with job searches. It's just really intimidating not having the comfort of school anymore and I'm so freaked out with how fast time is going and I can't find any way to slow it down.

For now, I hope this summer I'll keep my part-time job and just get paid to do murals around my city for a bit while I get my shit together. Hopefully I can create more design work, and keep making my portfolios better.

Before I go on, I am not of legal drinking age, and I have not ever had alcohol nor do I intend to…probably. I’ve been thinking about how interesting the drink combinations seem and suddenly turning 21 doesn’t seem so bad. At the same time, though, I dunno.

,CasualConversation,"I haven't had a friend since high school. The issue is me not 'putting myself out there.' I used to be really mentally unwell. Now I'm a lot better and can be ""normal""-ish, but I never leave the house aside from work or shopping. So it's totally my fault that I have no friends.

I honestly dread every birthday because I know I have no friends to have fun with. I pretty much just stay home, which is okay because I'm a total homebody. But I live with my parents so it feels a bit embarrassing. They're used to me being like this though...

The saddest birthdays so far were my 16th and my 18th, because those are the ""big ones"" in the USA, and I had no friends to celebrate it with. (*Edit: I'm laughing reading my post now, because I spent my 17th birthday in a psych ward, and somehow I still didn't find that one to be the saddest....lol)* Your 21st is actually supposed to be even bigger in the USA (legal drinking age = partying, bars, clubs, etc.). I guess I'm just sad that every milestone so far has been spent alone. But I love myself -- I am not bad company.

Today, for my birthday, I spent a ton of money getting a full-body massage because I always wanted to get one and I'm touch-deprived. It was relaxing, but not as much as I thought it would be, and it was kind of awkward. I'm still glad I did it though. The head massage was my favorite part; it makes me wish I had a loved one to play with my hair or massage my scalp. Things like massages for people like me are bittersweet, because, on one hand, it reminds you of the human intimacy you're missing, but, on the other hand, it does heal a part of your soul that's been crumbled to pieces from that chronic lack of intimacy.

It's late afternoon now and I'm laying in bed because the massage made me feel a little light-headed/sleepy and my legs still ache from yesterday's workout.

I don't have any plans for the evening. I am lucky that my family is planning on taking me somewhere fun this weekend, so please don't pity me! Tonight I'll probably just eat yummy food, maybe eat an edible, listen to good music, doodle, or work on my poems....not sure what else there is to do!

The issue is me not &amp;#39;putting myself out there.&amp;#39; I used to be really mentally unwell. Now I&amp;#39;m a lot better and can be &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot;-ish, but I never leave the house aside from work or shopping. So it&amp;#39;s totally my fault that I have no friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I honestly dread every birthday because I know I have no friends to have fun with. I pretty much just stay home, which is okay because I&amp;#39;m a total homebody. But I live with my parents so it feels a bit embarrassing. They&amp;#39;re used to me being like this though...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The saddest birthdays so far were my 16th and my 18th, because those are the &amp;quot;big ones&amp;quot; in the USA, and I had no friends to celebrate it with. (&lt;em&gt;Edit: I&amp;#39;m laughing reading my post now, because I spent my 17th birthday in a psych ward, and somehow I still didn&amp;#39;t find that one to be the saddest....lol)&lt;/em&gt; Your 21st is actually supposed to be even bigger in the USA (legal drinking age = partying, bars, clubs, etc.). I guess I&amp;#39;m just sad that every milestone so far has been spent alone. But I love myself -- I am not bad company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, for my birthday, I spent a ton of money getting a full-body massage because I always wanted to get one and I&amp;#39;m touch-deprived. It was relaxing, but not as much as I thought it would be, and it was kind of awkward. I&amp;#39;m still glad I did it though.

,CasualConversation,"Going into college, I wanted to study psychology. But I had a pivotal moment, it occurred in seconds, which caused me to turn away from my desire, my knowing, my life purpose.

My mom had good intentions. 

But I needed her love and approval from such an untouched core wound at the time.   
So when she said, ""you don't want to be in that rat race, do you? Listening to people's problems all day..."" 

…I felt ashamed. 

Ashamed that, in fact, I did want to. And I didn’t see it the way she did, at all. I was fascinated by relational dynamics and the internal processes of people. I loved inspiring others to create what they want. Even then. 

But I couldn't bear to conflict with an approval rating from my mom. Studying psychology was not getting a good grade in her book.   
So I abandoned it. 

I traveled for five years. All while feeling my purpose was lost, and this created a lot of anxiety. I wasn’t aware of why. It was the butterfly nomad journey v1.0, in my early 20's. 

I can't say I regret that period.

I lived in Israel and worked at a dive club on the Red Sea in Eilat as a divemaster / dive guide. I logged hundreds of dives, made friends with the reliable show of garden eels and lion fish. I took countless trips across the border to the Sinai in Egypt, so many I needed extra pages installed in my passport. I was and am still proud of that.

I traveled by myself to Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand. I met a hot Italian named Marco on the island of Kho Phangan, long before it became a modern tantra capital. I ended up having a two year story with him, where I lived with him part-time in his camper traveling around Tuscany selling hand-loomed bead jewelry I made. The other part of the time we lived in his Mom's apartment with his recently divorced and angry at everything sister La Gianna, and his raisin of a grandmother, La Tosca. Tosca must have withered down to about 80 pounds as she got into her later years. I learned Italian, ate the best food ever, witnessed with astonishment daily dramas at the dinner table, and of course... there was tall, dark and sexy AF: Marco.

My travels took me to Nigeria, Benin and Kenya in Africa. I could write a whole novel about those six months in Lagos, eating fried plantain and yucca every day and learning to speak Pigeon English. I'm leaving and I'm not coming back = me go go. I'm leaving, and I'll return = me go come. How delightful! I lived in a company house with 5 Israelis. That's also when all my early childhood Hebrew school came in handy, and my Hebrew elevated to mildly conversational. Yes, I learned Hebrew in Nigeria. At Passover, they made me do the four questions and they were amazed that I could read the Hebrew and knew the melody! We all celebrated and it was a great moment. 

So no, I don't regret that I turned away from getting a degree in psychology. I can't say I regret providing acupuncture to 5000 people over 20 years either. I met amazing people, some of whom I remain in contact with, and a few I think of as a friend, or even family. I can't say I regret all the pain washing from so many people's faces. The depth of gratitude for those who I truly helped turn around aggravating, debilitating, and scary health issues. It was all a gift.

And here I am, in my home town, another full circle. I'm reflecting about the path of my life and realize all along I've been studying psychology. I never stopped. I just didn't go the collegiate path.

&lt;p&gt;But I couldn&amp;#39;t bear to conflict with an approval rating from my mom. Studying psychology was not getting a good grade in her book.&lt;br/&gt;
So I abandoned it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I traveled for five years. All while feeling my purpose was lost, and this created a lot of anxiety. I wasn’t aware of why. It was the butterfly nomad journey v1.0, in my early 20&amp;#39;s. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t say I regret that period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lived in Israel and worked at a dive club on the Red Sea in Eilat as a divemaster / dive guide. I logged hundreds of dives, made friends with the reliable show of garden eels and lion fish. I took countless trips across the border to the Sinai in Egypt, so many I needed extra pages installed in my passport. I was and am still proud of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I traveled by myself to Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand. I met a hot Italian named Marco on the island of Kho Phangan, long before it became a modern tantra capital. I ended up having a two year story with him, where I lived with him part-time in his camper traveling around Tuscany selling hand-loomed bead jewelry I made. The other part of the time we lived in his Mom&amp;#39;s apartment with his recently divorced and angry at everything sister La Gianna, and his raisin of a grandmother, La Tosca. Tosca must have withered down to about 80 pounds as she got into her later years. I learned Italian, ate the best food ever, witnessed with astonishment daily dramas at the dinner table, and of course... there was tall, dark and sexy AF: Marco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My travels took me to Nigeria, Benin and Kenya in Africa. I could write a whole novel about those six months in Lagos, eating fried plantain and yucca every day and learning to speak Pigeon English. I&amp;#39;m leaving and I&amp;#39;m not coming back = me go go. I&amp;#39;m leaving, and I&amp;#39;ll return = me go come. How delightful! I lived in a company house with 5 Israelis. That&amp;#39;s also when all my early childhood Hebrew school came in handy, and my Hebrew elevated to mildly conversational. Yes, I learned Hebrew in Nigeria. At Passover, they made me do the four questions and they were amazed that I could read the Hebrew and knew the melody! We all celebrated and it was a great moment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So no, I don&amp;#39;t regret that I turned away from getting a degree in psychology. I can&amp;#39;t say I regret providing acupuncture to 5000 people over 20 years either. I met amazing people, some of whom I remain in contact with, and a few I think of as a friend, or even family. I can&amp;#39;t say I regret all the pain washing from so many people&amp;#39;s faces. The depth of gratitude for those who I truly helped turn around aggravating, debilitating, and scary health issues. It was all a gift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here I am, in my home town, another full circle. I&amp;#39;m reflecting about the path of my life and realize all along I&amp;#39;ve been studying psychology. I never stopped. I just didn&amp;#39;t go the collegiate path. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My morning take-away: the path never leaves you, even if it seems like you left it.&lt;/p&gt;

,CasualConversation,"Might not qualify as the weirdest flex but certainly one of the most bad ass.

Kerry Packer was Australia’s richest man worth around 8 billion some 20 years ago. His gambling feats were legendary. He would often go to casinos and win or lose 10 million plus in one sitting. One time he won $26 million playing 6 hands of blackjack at $200,000 each. That’s $1.2 million per hand.

On top of that, whilst some of these may not be 100% accurate (Urban legends can get twisted over time) they all have some element of truth.

He’s been known to tip croupiers and waitresses 100s of 1000s of dollars and paying off their mortgages. Once he accidentally tipped a waitresses tray and apologised and arranged to pay her $100,000+ mortgage. Another time a dealer was offered an $80,000 tip by Packer but respectfully declined, informing him dealers are not allowed to accept gratuities. Packer called over the Pit Boss and demanded the dealer be sacked on the spot. The Pit Boss fired her. Packer then pushed forward the $80,000 worth of chips before demanding the Pit Boss re-hire her.

But then came the Texan oil tycoon coin flip…

Packer was playing every box at a blackjack table and not allowing anyone else to play or back bet at the table. This was a common practice by Packer and indeed a lot of big gamblers. But one time there was a braggart Texan oil baron throwing his weight around, complaining and telling all and sundry he was a big deal. He’s rich, he doesn’t have to wait for a table and who was this buffoon hogging it…Packer doesn’t walk around telling everyone how good he is and he doesn’t like people who do…

So Packer swivels around in his seat only for the Texan to double down, pointing his finger at the face of Packer and yelling some choice words finishing with, “I’m worth $100 million!” Packer slowly leans back in his chair, pulls a coin out of his pocket, stares at the Texan and calmly says, “So you want to gamble hey? I’ll flip you for it.” He was serious.

As the Texan quietly slunk away into the shadows, Kerry turned back to the table and continued like nothing had happened.

,CasualConversation,"TL;DR - the title is self explanatory
Can you meet someone, fall in love with them, and then realise you would choose them over your family members (like parents or siblings)? On a  condition, that you have a healthy loving relationship with your family.

Okay, so now buckle up, I'll tell you the context

I love coming up with stories in my head and then draw art of it or make small writings etc.
And now I have this story but I'm not sure how realistic this one aspect of it is.

Basically, we have 2 people, let's call them Kei and May.

Kei grew up in a poor family; their mother and grandmother (whom they adored) passed away by the time they turned 13. Their father was a neglectful alcoholic, but not physically abusive.
They grew up on their own while also fully taking care of their 3 younger siblings.

May grew up materially well-off, but their blood family just didn't want to have anything do with them. So they were never needed by anyone; and people they loved always had someone else more important.

By the time the story starts both of the characters are in their late 20s, they fall in love and part of their dynamic is that Kei realises that May became their #1 priority. Now, here's a tricky part. 

Kei raised their siblings, part of the story is that at a certain point the siblings became the sole reason they carried on. Like, Kei lost themselves in this forced ""parenthood"" if yk what I mean?

And the siblings grew up fine; they are confident, self-sufficient and don't have major issues. Although it's clear they take Kei for granted at times.

It's easy to establish, that Kei *likes* May more, and prefers May's company. The two have a lot in common and suit each other perfectly. But is it really possible that this stranger becomes someone Kei cares even more about than their siblings?

What do you think? I've never been in love and I can't imagine choosing someone over my family so that's where I'm coming from

,CasualConversation,"Just a very interesting cultural difference I've encountered when I first visited USA.

I had an embarrassing moment the first time I was eating in a restaurant in USA. After they took my card and brought it back to my table, I filled the receipt with the ""tip"" and ""total"" amounts (of course I was aware that tipping in USA is a very different story than in Europe and I respected that everywhere), and... waited for someone to take my card again to complete the payment, because I thought they need to do that in order to take the tip!

After they took my card and brought it back to my table, I filled the receipt with the &amp;quot;tip&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;total&amp;quot; amounts (of course I was aware that tipping in USA is a very different story than in Europe and I respected that everywhere), and... waited for someone to take my card again to complete the payment, because I thought they need to do that in order to take the tip! It took several minutes of me exchanging awkward looks with my server before I called them and they explained that I don&amp;#39;t need to do anything more and I can just leave at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got used to that in the 2 weeks that I spent in the US, but it was still a weird feeling when I had to loose contact with my card!&lt;/p&gt;

You see, because the snails have been stepped on so many times before, and no kind souls had offered their help untill now, the snails thought it was a good idea to take over the world and destroy humanity.

Now I'm just doing my part as a citizen of the world to let you guys know about your imminent ruination.
Snails don't take being mass murdered everytime it rains kindly.

I tried reasoning with them. I told them hey not everyone is bad. Some people are just so distracted they don't even see you guys down there!

Of course, this helped a little bit as the snails calmed down. They thanked me for helping them out, they said they will return the favour by not taking over the world. 

As for today, you my beautiful friends won't have to worry about the snail threat anymore. U can sleep peacefully knowing u r safe. No need to thank me. just do me a favour. Try not to step on the little guy. aye?

Now, for the last 35 years, ever since I was born, my 1 constant in life is Super Mario. I’ve played practically every game, when a new game comes out, I play it. The oldest stuff I have from my childhood is Mario related.

I picked her up, took her to the TV, and she pointed to the Super Mario Bros Supershow. “Mynana” was actually “Mario”. We have never let her watch that before. I had no idea she knew who Mario was.

So i put it on, she started dancing to the Mario Bros Supershow rap at the beginning, when the show came on she sat there laughing and giggling and asking question. She called Toad “Baby”, Luigi is “Weegee” and Princess Toadstool/Peach is “Let it go” after Frozen.

On the drive to daycare, which is like 5 mins, she just wanted to listen to Mario. So I put the themesong to the show on and played it through my car speakers. She’s giggling and loving it.

,CasualConversation,"
So we are a friendgroup of 5 and have been very close for the past 6 months. Eat lunch together everyday (we are in high school) spend every free moment together, text all the time, hangout all the time, we are an established tightknit friend group. 

But me and another girl in the friend group have become way closer with each other than the rest of the group. The rest of the group is very hyperfocused on boys, parties, gossip, classic high school things. And me and this other girl are, i think, more school oriented while the others are completely uninterested in school. We go to a very competitive highly regarded acedemics focused school so the norm here is to be school oriented. So in this friend group we are not really well percieved and are kind of known as slackers.

And just the values with me and this girl are completely different from the other three, we are always the ones who don't smoke, when we go shopping with them they shoplift we dont, we dont drink regularly like them. So in general I think after so much time with them we both kind of checked out emotionally after being tired of the same surface level talks with them everyday, boys and talking bad about people, thats it. And I'm sure thats not their only interests and I am not trying to act like I am so much better than them because like a lot of people I also enjoy gossip and boy talk but thats all we talk about and I think we both just got tired of it.

Today me and this girl decided to seperate from the group for this one lunch to study for a big upcoming test, our logic was that everytime we try to study WITH them they dont really study and it just becomes another gossip session. And usually it would be okay but this is a really important test. We thought it wouldnt be a big deal. as soon as the bell rang we went up to a classroom and studied the entire lunch. At the end of the day when we spotted the group outside the school and as we walked up to them they looked at us and then turned and they all walked away. We texted them asking if they are mad and have gotten no response, it has been 5 hours and they are all always on their phone.

What should we do? We know its going to be drama with them and we don't want that.

-balance and ‘hippie’ related stuff like walking on pipes and slack lines 

-Calisthenics and body weight type exercises 

-high reps of low weight and low reps of higher weight 

-“full range” or “functional strength” kettlebell stuff, might be bro science idk 🤷‍♂️ but I like the idea 

-acrobatics and learning to jump and flip and spin and kick and such 

-Walk &gt; Jog &gt; Run, sprints and endurance 

-Hiking

-Swimming and body therapy in water

-Recreational movement, anything you do for fun, could be anything that pops into your head when ya hear that… or it could be like ultimate frisbee or a sport or skateboarding, snowboarding, long boarding, dancing, white water rafting, etc.

We're originally both from the Midwest, but have been living in the Bay Area (CA) for about 10 years. We now have a 1 year old, and for various reasons, are considering a move. We work from home, and cost of living thankfully won't be a deciding factor for us (most places, even cities, seem affordable compared to here).

Things we like/we're hoping for (not necessarily all of these):

\-We would love to be within driving distance of family in Michigan. By this I mean 10-12 hours or less ideally (so we could do it in a day or overnight), but honestly anything less than 15 would be a huge plus! Would consider a bit farther for the right place. We want our baby to see her grandparents and cousins more often!

\-I'm a writer and husband loves music, so somewhere with a decent arts community or working artists would be a plus. Can be music, visual arts, whatever. We're open to smaller cities/towns, but would ideally like a vibrant community.

\-A town/city or neighborhood of a city with other families with young kids. We'd love to meet new friends wherever we end up, and it would be nice to find some people in similar life stages.

\-We both love warm to hot weather and sunshine, but we're definitely open to snowy winters again for the right place. Would prefer more sunshine than Michigan though. This is one reason we don't want to live in MI. The lake effect and lack of winter sun does a number on us.

\-Cities are a plus, but we're definitely open to smaller communities that are within a couple hours from major metro areas, especially if there's public transit.

\-We were both raised in swing states and are somewhat open to a red state, but only if it's a liberal area/city/bubble.

\-Walkable downtown area is a plus, with at least a handful of good or decent restaurants.

\-Good public elementary schools, or at least upwardly trending if the place is changing.

\-Friendly, welcoming people would be a huge plus. We miss people saying hello on walks, etc.

\-We love the outdoors. Access to parks, green spaces, hiking a plus. Huge bonus if there are rivers, mountains, waterfalls, anything like that.

\-Beaches are a huge plus. We all love swimming.

If your home has some or most of these things, please tell me about it and why you love it! Thanks in advance!",t2_d10hrasx,False,,0,False,Where should we move? Please help!

,CasualConversation,"So if you had to be locked in one room of your house for a week, which room would you prefer it to be? 1 million dollars is on the line.

The rules:

* You can only bring 1 item from another room with you into the room you chose. If you have something in your pocket, that thing would be your 1 item, so you'd have to take it out if you didn't want it with you and choose a different item.
* You cannot take anything out of the room you chose that was already in there.
* Once you step into the room you chose, you'll be locked in and the week will begin. This rule is just to encourage you to choose your 1 item carefully.
* If there is a window in the room you chose, you can open it, but you cannot stick any part of your body out. Same goes for a door, you can open it, but you cannot stick any part of your body out.

Personally, I would choose my living room. I would be able to watch TV, sleep on the couch, sit at my desk to work, and use the treadmill / bike machine. My 1 item from another room would be a bag of dried mango slices; they are my go-to snack, so as long as I can stop myself from eating the entire bag in one day, I'll be okay.

,CasualConversation,"I've always been absolutely terrified of watching or reading horror because I'm an anxious person, always have been. Even goofy horror movies like The Haunted Mansion (2003) gave me nightmares, and I struggled to watch The Ring with my friends as a teenager. Couldn't get through the Goosebumps series. I watched The Evil Dead remake when I was 16 and actually screamed throughout it. 

But over the past year, I've been desensitizing myself with horror movies like Paranormal Activity, Cabin in the Woods, The Shining, Nope, then building up the intensity with things like House of 1000 Corpses, The Exorcist, Hereditary, and the podcast The Magnus Archives (I listened to 3 episodes, and couldn't continue it until a year later, and by that point I somehow found it calming??). Stories that involve home invasion are the scariest to me since I start hearing all the noises in my house even more than I usually do!

My family is half Polish (all on my mom’s side). My dad’s side of the family has similar ancestry, but has been in America longer. I went to Poland very frequently growing up, and have put in the time to learn in a lot of the language, although I can’t call myself fluent yet, but I hope to be within the next year.

I recently met someone else in college (we’ll call them Cary) who was fully born in Poland and transferred to America for college. We have had great conversation, but I met Cary after reaching out through other people. I was so excited to meet someone with this culture in common.

When we met in person, Cary seemed disappointed I was born in the US and had an American accent. When a mutual acquaintance talked to them alone and mentioned me, Cary went out of their way to clarify that I was only “half-polish”.

I don’t know. It just hurts. I’ve never claimed to be completely one thing or the other, and it’s always something I thought I could find cool about myself.

I’m highly introverted, and not conventionally good looking. I have least knowledge about makeup, and mess up with blending every single time. I come from poor background, and realised soon that development is pretty laid back kinda job and has potential to get you decent lifestyle. Anyways, my past experiences with managers have never been very good. Since I don’t speak a lot, and probably give under-confident vibe, managers automatically assume that I’m dumb and always need a male guidance. I’m not super smart either. I consider myself average, but I’m a major observant, and surprisingly, most of my peers are also average.

This new company also has one such manager who dislikes me. I don’t know why. I even have been courageous to ask him directly about it, but he would deny it downright, and tell me that I’m being hysterical. He would treat me, and my guy teammate totally opposite. It just breaks my heart. He avoids all suggestions made by me, but would entertain my guy team member if he gave the same solution to a problem.

I have left my past companies within less than 2 years due to the environment. But I have been year for about 3 years. The reason is the CEO of the company. When I left my past company, my mental health was at its lowest. I used to beat myself up for every single thing (still do but in less intensity). Furthermore, my family wasn’t doing too good personally and financially. I also got diagnosed with RA at that time. I met my current CEO during that time. They took this entrance exam, which I performed bad at, as I was not ready. But I discussed the entire paper, along with my solutions with him, and he was just so thrilled by me. I don’t know how I managed to charm him then. He used to be a model, so he has great physique, is conventionally super attractive and a brilliant person. He became my favourite person really soon. He would support me, listen to my ideas, provide feedback, and have genuine interest in discussions. He provides me credit where it is due, which almost never happened in my 5 years of experience. All this when we’ve never met personally. He is in foreign country.

,CasualConversation,"It's currently 11pm for me. I'm a smoker but I typically don't go outside past like 9. I have raccoons that come on my patio and coyotes and such that linger around my creek that's about 20 feet from my apt. I'm also just afraid of what goes bump in the night. I live in the mountains, in the Appalachians. I very much believe in legends and things, beings, we don't understand or have proof of. 

I just finished up working on an assignment, and decided to risk it for the biscuit. I just stood outside my door and didn't go on my patio so I had light and a quick escape incase a raccoon appeared. 

I'm standing there and I notice there's a weird, constant noise in the distance. I've never heard anything like it. Not quite sure how to explain it but it sounded like a uniform, collective, highpitch humming/vocalization? 

It wasn't steady, the pitch and volume would rise and lower. It was constant though with no breaks. I smoke a cigarette in maybe 8ish minutes and it was happening the entire time. It didn't sound human at all, and it sounded like hundreds of something contributing to it. 

It sounded like something straight out of a horror movie. One of the songs they'd play towards the end of the movie as the main character is exploring, or discovering something. Right before the big bad whatever happens. 

I'm not saying this noise was necessarily anything of the paranormal/other worldly nature but I don't know what the fuck. My guess is maybe somehow a collection of bugs or whatever matched eachother in just the right way to make whatever that was. 

It was kind of centralized, too. It was in an area behind the building next to mine. My building is like this __  that building is like this / next to me. So __ /. It was coming from behind it, kind of near a bridge and the creek over there. It was also pretty loud, like no doubts I was actually hearing that.

,CasualConversation,"So when I was 13, two of my friends came to my house looking visibly scared. I asked them if they wanted to go play outside but they said that they prefered staying inside my house playing videogames and that they didn't want to go outside no matter what .

I noticed something was clearly wrong with them and asked them what had happened.

They said that they had just fought with a bunch of other kids (who were a year older than us) and that they managed to run away and had come to my house to hide.

A few minutes passed and my house's telephone rang while we were playing Super Smash Bros Brawl. I recognized the caller as one of the older kids my friends were fleeing from. He asked me if my friends were with me and I told him that they had stopped by a short while ago but that I had denied them entry to my house because I had homework to do. (Obviously this was a lie, both of them were inside the house playing videogames). By the way, my parents had gone shopping so we were home alone. 

So anyways, more time passed and two other friends  came to my house. I welcomed them in, but they insisted we should get out of the house and play outside. The other two friends who had first came to the house explained them the situation but they insisted we had to get out. 

Until finally they spilled the beans and told us that they had been forced by the older kids to lure us all out of the house and had threatened to beat us all up (themselves included) if they refused. The older kids had surrounded my house and were hiding behind some nearby bushes, waiting for us to fall for their trap. 

So to recap: there's the two friends who had fought with the older kids and had come to my house to hide from them, there's the other two friends who the older kids tried to turn against us but ultimately decided to stick with us and then there's me, who unwillingly got caught up in all of this and all 5 of us were being besieged inside my house by the gang of older kids who were waiting outside to beat us all up.

The siege continued as did the Smash Bros matches for neary two hours until one of my friends got a call from his dad who told him he had to go cut his hair. My friend explained to his dad where he was and what was going on, and finally, a few minutes afterwards, the older kids surrounding my house all ran away when my friend's dad rode to my house on his van and yelled at them. 

The 5 of us exited the house in cheers and the older kids never threatened us again. And so...one of the craziest and most memorable annecdotes from my childhood came to an end.

,CasualConversation,"Hi all!

I was a middle child growing up. Born in the early 90s. My older sibling was 10 years older than myself. In the late 90s/early 2000s my family and older sibling recorded most of stuff we did. I've almost never looked at the footage.

Very recently my mother asked me to turn all the VHS tapes into a digital format. I have been sitting hours/days watching footage of me and my siblings growing up. Videos at the house, friends, family, pers, everything.

I almost remember NOTHING from the footages. I am in my 30s now. Each time I watch some footage and remember a fraction of something from it, I can honestly say I can't remember anything deep in my memory.

It makes me really wonder how much I don't remember like at all. Just for some examples from the footages.

I don't remember anything about the layout of my childroom room/house throughout the years. Childhood pets, making dumb videos with family and friends, ect. 

Is this normal?

Fantasy football.  I got very into to the point of having over 90 teams one year.  Now I'm down to about 5 per season and I like it, but I would never think about having that many teams again.

Drawing.  For about two years, I studied drawing and practiced a LOT.  I actually got pretty good at it, but then lost interest.  Now, I'll doodle a bit if I'm bored, but never want to sit for hours doing it.

Music.  I spent about a year playing guitar for a couple of hours per day until one day, I just didn't feel like it anymore. I have a couple of guitars sitting here that I have touched in months.

Building websites.  I have literally built hundreds of them over the years with varying degrees of success.  I'm currently coming off of a period of interest, but generally don't feel like messing with the 5 current ones I've got up.

,CasualConversation,"I posted about this on another page and the TL;DR is that a food worker very early on (3rd time seeing me) kept giving me free food on top of the food I already paid for. It started with her, after I ordered my food, asking if I wanted a side as if I wanted to order more, to which I declined. When she said she'd give it on the house, I declined because inflation is crazy right now; Then it followed with her flat out putting the free side in my bag the next time. And now it's her adding full dishes/meals that cost equal to or around the same price as what I paid for.

I've spent a good month or so finding logical reasons as to why she keeps doing this but none make sense (1. No need to keep me as a customer because they have plenty. the food she gives me cost more than what I tip. Plus I imagine those tips: signing via credit card, go to the store and not her). I even asked people from the country that the store and she is based in and they still don't really add up. So, I kind of just accepted it for a few weeks. 

I was thinking of just personally tipping her the equivalent of the free food she's given me ($54.26 up to this point) wishing her well and then not coming back again. I'll miss that dish I always order but I just don't know. Consistent free things while being a new customer seemed odd to me. So, casual redditors how would you go about managing a situation like this?

TL;DR (from previous post) Manager (waitress? server?) quickly began giving free food on top of the food I pay for and I don't know why. No one I know gets free food from there either. Thanks y'all.

EDIT- I posted this about an hour before I was headed to the restaurant. And the answers here gave me a great idea. I ended up buying cookies for her and the staff to which they greatly appreciated. It was from there that we got to formally introduce each other (yes. I literally didn’t even know her name). Turns out she’s the manager there; hence why she has the bandwidth to keep giving me free food. I won’t stop going there (was weekly), but I will limit the amount of times; I just don’t want her to think she owes me anything or that I go there just for free food benefits.

,CasualConversation,"Basically, my college friend - Terry (23F) - calls me up today and invites me to a bar with her friend Viola (20F) and a guy from Spain - Mathias (23M) (all names are made up).

I think about whether I should go, since I'm tired and short on money. I set on not going, but at 9pm Terry hits me up saying they're at this arcade place and I should join them, they're drinking, it's super fun

My fomo kicks in, I get ready and go. 12am - I arrive to the arcade-bar. It looks nothing like on their website, it's a very cheap looking basement bar. I can't pay by card, so I end up going out to withdraw cash.

I come back, Terry and Viola are pretty drunk. I drink my Skinny Bitch cocktail and the 2 of them + Matthias push for getting tequila shots. They had 4 before I arrived. I am against cause I am a tequila hater + they're drunk. Eventually, I cave in. At the bar turns out they're short on cash so I end up buying tequila shot for Terry.

While waiting for our shots the 2 girls are all over me - hugging and touching - while I hate physical touch and it's hot af in that basement. Anyways.

We get shots - it's horrible. Terry disappears immediately to the bathroom, saying she doesn't feel well. I end up playing a bunch of this arcade games and I lose all of them... I also payed for those lmao

Afterwards we go looking for Terry since it's been a while. She's a MESS. She's throwing up, Viola goes into a stall with her, me and Mathias end up thinking how to get home. I end up getting water and looking for plastic bags. Terry breaks a glass with water, Viola's bleeding cause she cut herself on the glass. Long story short - while Terry was throwing a tantrum about not leaving the bathroom stall I had to quite roughly force her out to get some air and go home (she was afraid to throw up on the way even though we could tell she physically couldn't lmao).

We're out on the street. Viola wanted to take public transportation to which I said absolutely not - Terry can't even stand on her own. Viola and Mathias have their phones with no battery. I end up taking Terry's phone to call Uber, to which Terry - in the mids of her being drunk - starts looking for promo codes cause the trip's expensive lmao.

I check my phone and boom! I have uber promo code. I end up ordering a car from my account and paying for it since they have no cash. After sending Terry, Viola and Mathias home (they live together) I look at my screen only to realise.... I can't order an Uber for myself while they're driving 💀

I end up taking a bus home. I get home at 3am and just laugh uncontrollably cause I REALLY should've just stayed home and watched that Adam Sandler/Jennifer Aniston movie lmao

I am 23 years old and just graduated college a year ago. I jumped right into a sales job after college where the money is decent, management is great and I get to work from home a couple days a week. I enjoy sales but it can be demanding/difficult. The company offers PTO, but since it’s a sales job, it’s hard to step away for a vacation to relax when you are still expected to hit your quota on the month.

I feel that I have already become burnt out from this job and am considering quitting this job to go back to serving for more money, less hours, flexibility to travel, enjoy more free time and focus on learning new skills to hopefully work for myself some day. I served all through college and loved it, and also made great money working much less hours than I am working now. I am thinking of doing this for 1-2 years, while figuring out if I can work for myself. If it doesn’t work out, I can always go back to a corporate job, but my lack of experience in the field may make that difficult since I’ve only been working this job for 1 year. However, I also feel like now would be the best time in my life to do this, as I am still able to utilize my parents health insurance until 26 years old.

,CasualConversation," 

Hey everyone! I just wanted to share a little story that brightened up my day and reminded me of the power of friendship, even when you're miles apart.

So, I came to the UK for studies about a year ago, and while it has been a great experience overall, I started to feel homesick recently. The thing I was missing the most was the food from my country, India. The taste, the spices, the warmth – it's a unique experience that I just couldn't find here.

As the homesickness grew, I started feeling really down and lost my motivation to do anything. I didn't realize how much it was affecting me until one of my closest friends from back home noticed my change in behavior.

You won't believe what she did next!

She took it upon herself to order some authentic Indian food online and had it delivered straight to my doorstep here in the UK! I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the delivery guy at my door with a package full of delicious Indian treats.

Her kind gesture filled me with happiness and gratitude. It's amazing how something as simple as food from home can lift your spirits and bring a sense of comfort. Not only did it help with my homesickness, but it also reminded me of the wonderful friendships I have and the importance of staying connected, no matter the distance.

I just wanted to share this story with all of you to remind us that even the smallest acts of kindness can make a huge difference in someone's life. Have any of you experienced something similar or have a story to share about a friend who went out of their way to make you feel better?

,CasualConversation,"     Hello everyone, i’m just generally curious if anyone can give advice on the way i’m feeling lately. 

I hope I don’t end up sounding insane or crazy, but I get influenced by the SMALLEST things. For some reason I feel like I need to have my entire personality based off of my music, style, etc. 
For more context, I listen to a lot of rock, metal, heavy metal, and so on. 

Here’s where it’s going to get a little strange, my mind can accept the fact that I can listen to other genres of music such as R&amp;B but as soon as I listen to it, I become an entire different person. 

I rarely listen to any type of pop but my favorite pop artist is Ariana Grande, when I listen to her music I feel as if I change completely. My style, fashion, taste in EVERYTHING changes. 

Then two days later, I listen to my everyday rock playlist and I go back to my other personality. It feels like I have a personality for some genres of music because I’ll change as a person completely. 

Now let’s talk about the emotions part, I can never stick to feeling just one emotion, and I mean my emotions will change quickly. I cry EXTREMELY easily. I’m an overly emotional person. So I’ll be having a good day and the slightest, TINIEST thing can make me go from normal, to fuming mad and my entire day is ruined. 

Sometimes I wake up and feel little to no emotion, like an empty slate. Completely blank. 

I’d like to consider myself to be an affectionate person, but there will be weeks that go by where I can not stand any type of affection. The words and actions of love completely disgust and irritate me beyond words. But when that passes, i love hugs, telling people I love them, and so on. 

This makes it difficult for me to maintain any sort of relationships, I’ve ruined my happiest relationship with somebody because I woke up and my love for them felt like it disappeared. I played the waiting game and decided to end it because I didn’t want to hurt them. I felt nothing for months and one day all the love I had for him came crashing back and it’s been two years, surprise, surprise, I think about him multiple times a week and regret it. 

Last but not least, I have really impulsive urges. My hair used to be down to my waist, I started cutting it an inch a week to about my shoulders. One day out of nowhere, I messaged my friend and she ended up shaving my hair. I finally let it grow out to where it was at my shoulders and last week I cut it to my chin. 

These last three weeks i’ve been overthinking like CRAZY, I’ve barely been feeling any type of emotion and the only reason i’m writing this and sharing it is because I’m losing it and don’t know what to do. 

Any advice is GREATLY appreciated. :)",t2_9toc54tb,False,,0,False,"I keep wanting to change myself based on small things, and lose touch with my emotions.

The Damn United is a biographical novel which about the tumultuous tenure of legendary manager Brian Clough with Leeds United in the first division of English football, in the 1974 - 1975 season. 

The narrative is in the form of stream of consciousness from Clough’s perspective as he grapples with his demons to steer redeem his managerial career and steer Leeds United to footballing success. 

Peace’s writing is visceral and reads like a thriller. He does a fantastic job in bringing to light the grimy realities of British society of the 70s.

I apologize if I offended anyone with this post. It wasn’t my intention at all. I posted this yesterday without thinking about it and honestly didn't think it would get this much attention. Obviously, I know I’m not the only woman in the world who doesn't wear makeup LOL I wasn’t trying to be quirky or a pick me by saying that. Maybe the way I've worded things has come across as insensitive or offensive and I never intended that. 

So today I was chatting with some girls in my college class and one of them asked what makeup I was wearing. I replied that I wasn’t wearing any. I’ve never worn makeup apart from twice in my life (my prom + a wedding) They couldn’t believe it and said I must at least wear at least concealer etc but I don’t and never have. 

My skin has always been clear apart from the occasional pimples and the only thing I put on my face is moisturizer. Plus I don’t like the feel of makeup. It’s too heavy feeling.

,CasualConversation,"I am tired of being made to feel less than by my relatives who are trying to immegrate to the US.

I come from a under developed or developing nation that has a huge diasphora. 

 I am tired of my uncle living in the US and looking to gain citizenship there, visit us only to get a health check ups. My grandmother has a ""health friend card"" issued by the government that offers free or cheap healthcare to everyone in her family. Uncle got a cavity and took a leave during Christmas to visit us and get his tooth fixed on our governments money. My father took him to there and he apparently complained and laughed about everything he saw on the street on the way.
 Imagine how that makes my father feel.

 You arent fleeing a war. A good life is possible in this country,  and its okay if you choose to have a better one. But then stick by your choice and dont pretend like someone kicked you out. My grandmothers generation was a refugee generation and she speakes about ""home"" with a pang of sadness coz she really cant go back no matter what. Then there is my cousin (said uncles' daughter) making reels saying stuff like ""smell of chai is smell of home and how she misses home"". I am sorry you face racism in the US but yours and grandmas experiences are different. Both valid, but different. 

You have been here twice. No you dont know what its like to navigate our festivals.  I know that so stop telling me how to do things based on the much muted celebration you have there. Also, stop asking me to visit and try the american dream the minute i mention some inconvenience.

 This is a free world and people should be allowed to choose their way through life and i support that.  I myself do not want to  leave. I just feel like if i have to uproot my life, what i get in return has to be 99% perfect. I am okay with my crappy life in my crappy country, i should not be made to feel bad about that.

&lt;p&gt;I come from a under developed or developing nation that has a huge diasphora. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am tired of my uncle living in the US and looking to gain citizenship there, visit us only to get a health check ups. My grandmother has a &amp;quot;health friend card&amp;quot; issued by the government that offers free or cheap healthcare to everyone in her family. Uncle got a cavity and took a leave during Christmas to visit us and get his tooth fixed on our governments money. My father took him to there and he apparently complained and laughed about everything he saw on the street on the way.
 Imagine how that makes my father feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You arent fleeing a war. A good life is possible in this country,  and its okay if you choose to have a better one. But then stick by your choice and dont pretend like someone kicked you out. My grandmothers generation was a refugee generation and she speakes about &amp;quot;home&amp;quot; with a pang of sadness coz she really cant go back no matter what. Then there is my cousin (said uncles&amp;#39; daughter) making reels saying stuff like &amp;quot;smell of chai is smell of home and how she misses home&amp;quot;.

,CasualConversation,"A little over a year ago while visiting home for Christmas, I tried to run a small 30-minute D&amp;D encounter for my family.

About four minutes in, he started snoring while still sitting up, and so we all just laughed and let him rest. All in all, a successful game!

Unfortunately he did pass a few months ago, a few days after Christmas. I moved home to be close to my Mom and sister, and they convinced me to DM a longer running game, which I happily agreed! Last night during our introductory session, I decided to introduce a ""Sleepy Knight"", inspired by my Dad's Knight character he ""played"" that night so long ago by sleeping through it. During the session, he followed the party around yawning, and deciding to grab a quick nap anytime the real fighting started. It resulted in smiles and laughs from the family, immortalizing him into the game and allowing that funny memory to live on with us. I think I'll make sure he tags along for future adventures.

,CasualConversation,"Heyy everyone, I am 29f and I am thinking about moving 9 hours away from where I currently live. I am a single mother to a 5f. I've been debating of moving for a long time. When I was a teenager I planned on moving to a big city (I grew up in a small town) but that never happened for me. I got pregnant at 23 and suddenly became single, I moved into my sisters house while I was pregnant and have experienced a lot of abuse since then.

Anyways, now that I am turning 30 in a few months and have gotten some of my independence back since having my baby, I really want to move. I am currently stuck in this rental/housing market, living with my mother who has always been abusive towards me. I have been saving my money and I will be ready to move in the summer, I am planning to move for Aug as I want to move between school semesters for my child.

I am currently planning on moving to a city where I know no one. That was not my original plan as I was thinking to move to my brothers city that is currently 11 hours away from me. However due to a language curve I would rather stay in a city 9 hours away that speaks the same language as me and I can keep my current bank and whatnot.

I have not told many people my plan as I found many people including my family always immediately dismiss all my thoughts and feelings. However, today I told one of my friends who I've been keeping relatively updated, however she made a comment that I was running away. She also grew up abused and has no family support, but she does have a romantic partner that shes had long term. 

Personally I do not feel like I am running away. I feel like I am running to a freedom I have never had before, and I will no longer be around people who have abused me as a child. I want the fresh start that I was chastised for. 

I can see how this maybe considered 'running away' since I want to escape all my abusers and I want to have freedom, and I want to stop feeling like sh\*t every holiday, I want to be happy. I know I wont get this staying in my hometown my whole life.

I know I did not give a lot of personal details, but what do you think? Were you confronted by family members for 'running away' or ruining anyone's relationships with your child?

Is it okay for me to be selfish right now or should I stay so my child can have a relationship with the same people who abused me?

All I know is that it smells hard and handimen use it for everything. In all of my life I've never used the stuff or seen where the substance in its packaging.

So Anyway.

Today I was looking to do some DIY work on dyes, and after many fails with other substances, all tutorials I see are in english since there are greater sharing channels. One tutorial suggested using Paint ""Thinner"", I first need to do a small sample so I look in my arts and crafts drawer and look for one.

Before doing the sample I research how expensive this is going to be for a big project, and see that I need 5L of the stuff, the bottle Im currently using is 150ml and is around 3USD. But hopefully a larger bucket will be cheaper. 


While looking for the Solvent on between all the ""Solvent"" buckets I see a ""Thinner"" bucket. I carefully click on the ad listing cause I don't want to import it, (in which this ad actually was).

Somehow I feel my neurons creating a path between ""Thinner"" and ""Tinner"". Had to double check with someone in the room, and called me dumb(affectionate).

,CasualConversation,"Sorry for the long post but it’s kind of a long story.

My husband was born in the Philippines 26 years ago. His bio mom had a very hard life and my husband is actually her third child. She had her first child when she was 21 and the second when she was 23. The first two children were given to friends of hers because she was unable to care for or support a child financially. When she gave birth to my husband, she tried her hardest to care for him. She felt guilty with what she had done with her first two children even though she could still visit them. Because of the financial difficulties she ended up giving him to one of her friends who didn’t have any kids and her friend then gave my husband up for adoption without his mother’s consent. She tried very hard to get him back, but since she did not have the money or resources, she did not regain her parental rights. 

He was adopted by a very nice family in the United States. His adoptive family had one baby but after that became infertile so they decided to adopt. He had a great childhood with a loving family. He always knew he was adopted but they never made him feel like he wasn’t a true part of their family.

Earlier this year my husband showed me the packet that the adoption company made for him which included pictures of his bio mom and her name so I decided to search for her online and I found her. I told him and he seemed surprised that I found her and told me to wait to do anything. We talked about how to approach the situation because he wanted to be sensitive towards his adoptive mom’s feelings because she was the mom that raised him and he didn’t know how she might feel but he wanted to let his biological mother know that he was okay and that he has a happy life. We have our own daughter together and as a mother I couldn’t imagine not seeing my baby ever again or never knowing what happened to her. We talked to his adoptive family and they were 100 percent okay with it and encouraged him to reach out so we did. 

It was a very emotional first conversation. We video chatted with them and they cried upon seeing each other for the first time in 26 years. She doesn’t speak a lot of English so we have to have someone else translate it or use Google translate. She had three more children after my husband who all live with her and she got married. She is very happy to be a grandmother and to have her son back in her life. We hope one day we can go to the Philippines to meet them and so they can reunite in person. We even started a fundraiser and made a plan for saving money so hopefully in a year or so we can go!

,CasualConversation,"So I [22M] have a group of friends [21M], [21M2], [25M]. Let’s call them 1, 2, and 3, respectively. 

I’ve been very close friends with friend 1 since my freshman year of high school. I’ve also known friend 3 since high school, we weren’t close but I knew who he was.

Last year, friend 1 introduced me to his childhood friend, friend 2, and we clicked instantly. It’s like the three of us knew each other for years. Throughout the past year, we’ve hung out a shit ton.

About 10 months ago, friend 3 started hanging out with us more. The more time friend 3 spent with us, the more I got to know him and the more I realize I do not like him as a person.
